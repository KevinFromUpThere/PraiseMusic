 [D]Light of the [A]world, You stepped[G] down into darkness,
 [D]Opened my [A]eyes, let me[G] see;
 [D]Beauty that [A]made this[G] heart adore You,
 [D]Hope of a [A]life spent with [G]You.

 [(B7)]Here I am to [D]worship, here I am to [A]bow down,
 Here I am to [D]say that You're my [G]God;
 You're altogether [D]lovely, altogether [A]worthy,
 Altogether [D/F#]wonderful to[G] me.

 [D]King of all [A]days, oh so[G] highly exalted,
 [D]Glorious in [A]Heaven[G] above;
 [D]Humbly You [A]came to the[G] earth You created,
 [D]All for loveâ€™s [A]sake became[G] poor.
