 You're the [A]Lion of Judah, the [D]Lamb that was[A] slain,
 You ascended to heaven and [D]ever more will[E] reign;
 At the [A]end of the age when the [D]earth You r[A]eclaim,
 You will gather the nations b[E]efore You.||
 And the eyes of all men|will be fixed on the Lamb,|who was [D]cruc[E]ified
 For with wisdom and mercy|and justice You'll reign|at Your [D]Fatherâ€™s[E] side

 And the [A]angels will cry: '[D]Hail [A]the [E]Lamb
 Who was [A]slain for the world, [D]Rule [A]in [E]power.'
 And the [A]earth will reply: '[D]You [A]shall [E]reign
 As the [A]King of all kings and the [D]Lord of  all   [A]lords.'

 There's a s[A]hield in our hand and a [D]sword at our [A]side,
 There's a fire in our spirits that c[D]annot be d[E]enied;
 As the [A]Father has told us for t[D]hese You have [A]died,
 For the nations that gather[E] before You.||

 And the ears of all men|need to hear of the Lamb|who was cr[D]ucif[E]ied,
 Who descended to hell|yet was raised up to reign|at the Fat[D]her's si[E]de.
