 I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
 Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You
 In surrender I must give my every part
 Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart

 Jesus what can I give, what can I bring
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung
 As a praise of Your Name for the things You have done?

 O my words cannot tell, not even a part
 Of the debt that is owed by this thankful heart

 You deserve my every breath for Youâ€™ve paid a great cost
 Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
 Opened up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in
