 Only the Lord is good,
 Only the Lord brings healing,
 Only the Lord is powerful and mighty.
 He can save from the pain of this world.

 Well He wants to hold you tight
 And bring shelter through the night
 'Cause there's healing in His hand.

 Well I'm ready for You to look O Lord
 In my heart's secret book
 'Cause I know You'll understand.
