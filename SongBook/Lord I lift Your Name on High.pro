 Lord, I lift Your Name on high
 Lord, I love to sing Your praises
 I’m so glad You’re in my life
 I’m so glad You came to save us

 You came from heaven to earth to show the Way
 From the earth to the cross my debt to pay
 From the cross to the grave
 From the grave to the sky
 Lord I lift Your Name on high
