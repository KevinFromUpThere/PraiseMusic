 [E]I [A] believe in[B] Jesus,
 [E]I believe He [A]is the Son of[B] God;
 [E]I believe He [A]died and[B] rose again,
 [E]I believe He [A]paid for us[B] all.

 [A2]And I[B] believe that He's [E]here now, (echo: I believe You're[A] here,)
 [B]Standing in our[E] midst;
 [A2]With the [B]power to [E]heal now, (echo: With the power to[A] heal,)
 And the [B]grace to fo[E]rgive.
