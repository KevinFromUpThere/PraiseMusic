[V1]
. G                  D
  You led me to the cross,
.                Em     Em7
 And I saw Your face of mercy
.    C
 In that place of love.
. G                 D
 ||You opened up my eyes
.                Em       Em7
 To believe Your sweet salvation,
.      C
 Where I'd been so blind.
. A               Am     D        G            D
    Now that I'm living in Your all-forgiving love,
. C#dim         C         D       G
      My every road leads to the cross.
 
[C]
.      D                  Em
 Jesus, keep me near the cross,
. C              D                   G
     I won't forget the love You've shown.
.        D                Em
 Saviour, teach me of the cross,
. C                        Am
   I won't forget the love,
.             D                    G                     
  I won't forget the love You've shown.

[V2]
 And there's an empty tomb,
 That tells me of Your resurrection
 And my life in You.
 ||The stone lies rolled away,
 Nothing but those folded grave clothes
 Where Your body lay.
 Now that I'm living as a risen child of God,
 My every road leads to the cross.
