[V1]
 Thank You, Jesus, thank You, Jesus,
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me.
 Thank You, Jesus, thank You, Jesus,
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me.
[V2]
 You went to Calvary, 
 And there You died for me, 
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me. 
 You went to Calvary, 
 And there You died for me, 
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me.
[V3]
 You rose up from the grave, 
 To me new life You gave, 
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me. 
 You rose up from the grave, 
 To me new life You gave, 
 Thank You, Lord, for loving me.
[V4]
 You're coming back again,
 And we with you shall reign
 Thank You Lord, for loving me.
 You're coming back again,
 And we with you shall reign
 Thank You Lord, for loving me.</lyrics>
