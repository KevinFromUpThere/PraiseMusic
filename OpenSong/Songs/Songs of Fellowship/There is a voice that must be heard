. C                    F/C
 There is a voice that must be heard,
. C                    F/C
 There is a song that must be sung;
. Am                  F               G
 There is a name that must be lifted high.
. C                  F/C
 There is a treasure more than gold,
. C               F/C
 There is a King upon the throne;
. Am                  F                   G
 There is One whose praise will fill the skies.

 Jesus, Jesus,   Friend of mine.

 There is a peace that calms our fears,
. C                  F/C
 There is a love stronger than death;
. Am                  F                G
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave.
. C                    F/C
 There is a Friend who won't let go,
. C                    F/C
 There is a heart that beats for you;
. Am               F                G
 There is one name by which we are saved.

. Dm           G              Dm
    When I was captive to my fears,
.              G              Dm
 You were the One who came to me,
. G              Am  G F
     You set me free.
.                Am  G F
     You set me free.</lyrics></song>
