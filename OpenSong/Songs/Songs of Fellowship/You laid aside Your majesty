[V1]
.G             D             Em
    You laid aside Your majesty, 
.           Bm             C
    Gave up everything for me, 
.            G               Am              D
    Suffered at the hands of those You had created. 
. G          D                 Em
    You took all my guilt and shame, 
.             Bm              C
    When You died and rose again; 
.          G   
    Now today You reign, 
.      Am                 D
    In heaven and earth exalted.
[C]
. G                    D              Em
    I really want to worship You, my Lord, 
.                    Bm             C
    You have won my heart and I am Yours 
.       A              Am
    For ever and ever, 
.           D
    I will love You. 
. G                   D               Em
    You are the only one who died for me, 
.              Bm             C
    Gave Your life to set me free, 
.         A               Am         D   G
    So I lift my voice to You in adoration.
