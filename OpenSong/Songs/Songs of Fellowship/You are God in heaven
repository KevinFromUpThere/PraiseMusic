[V1]
.G                G+
 You are God in heaven,
.     Em/G         C
 And here am I on earth;
.G          G+             Em/G C
   So I'll let my words be few:
. Am    G/B   C     D        G
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
 
[C]
.           G       F      Em   C
 And I'll stand in awe of You,
.           G       F      Em   C
 Yes, I'll stand in awe of You.
.          Am     G/B      C
 And I'll let my words be few:
. Am   G/B   C      D        G
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
 
[V2]
 The simplest of all love songs
 I want to bring to You;
 So I'll let my words be few:
 Jesus, I am so in love with You.
