.G                D          G
 O for a thousand tongues to sing 
.     C    C/B  Am  Am/G  D
 The great Redeemer's        praise, 
.     G     Em D A    D
 The great Redeemer's praise! 
.G    D       G    C  C/B Am Am/G  D
 The glories of my God       and   King, 
.    G               C       G D G C Am D G
 The triumphs of His grace!
[V2]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears, 
 That bids our sorrows cease, 
 That bids our sorrows cease; 
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 
 'Tis life, and health, and peace.
[V3]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
 He sets the prisoner free, 
 He sets the prisoner free; 
 His blood can make the foulest clean, 
 His blood availed for me.
[V4]
 He speaks and, listening to His voice, 
 New life the dead receive, 
 New life the dead receive; 
 The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, 
 The humble poor believe.
[V5]
 Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb, 
 Your loosened tongues employ, 
 Your loosened tongues employ; 
 Ye blind, behold your Saviour come; 
 And leap, ye lame, for joy!
[V6]
 My gracious Master and my God, 
 Assist me to proclaim, 
 Assist me to proclaim, 
 To spread through all the earth abroad 
 The honours of Thy name.
