.G                  D    
  I'm giving You my heart, 
.             D/B  C
 And all that is within,
.         D   Em
 I lay it all down 
.         D/F#           G 
 For the sake of You, my King.
.                   D
 I'm giving You my dreams, 
.            D/B     C
 I'm laying down my rights,
.           D       Em
 I'm giving up my pride 
.          D/F#          G
 For the promise of new life.
 
[C]
.    Em D/F#     G      C      G   Em     D     C  
 And I______ surrender all to You, all to You.
     Em D/F#     G      C      G   Em     D     C  
 And I______ surrender all to You, all to You.
 
[V2]
.G                     D    
 I'm singing You this song, 
.            D/B     C
 I'm waiting at the cross,
.             D          Em
 And all the world holds dear, 
.  D/F#             G 
 I count it all as loss.
.                        D
 For the sake of knowing You, 
.          D/B     C
 The glory of Your name,
.             D       Em
 To know the lasting joy, 
.            D/F#      G
 Even sharing in Your pain.
