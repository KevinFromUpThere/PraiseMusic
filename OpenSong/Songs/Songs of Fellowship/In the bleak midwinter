  <lyrics> 
[V1]
 In the bleak midwinter,
 Frosty wind made moan;
 Earth stood hard as iron,
 Water like a stone.
 Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
 Snow on snow; Snow on snow
 In the bleak midwinter,
 Long long ago.
[V2]
 Heaven cannot hold Him,
 Nor earth sustain,
 Heaven and earth shall flee away
 When He comes to reign.
 In the bleak midwinter
 A stable-place sufficed
 The Lord God Almighty,
 Jesus Christ.
[V3]
 Angels and archangels
 May have gathered there,
 Cherubim and seraphim
 Thronged the air.
 But His mother only,
 In her maiden bliss,
 Worshipped the Beloved
 With a kiss.
[V4]
 What can I give Him,
 Poor as I am?
 If I were a shepherd,
 I would bring a lamb.
 If I were a wise man,
 I would do my part;
 Yet what I can I give Him -
 I will give my heart.
