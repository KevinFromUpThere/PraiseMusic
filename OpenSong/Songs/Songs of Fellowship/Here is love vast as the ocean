[V1]
 Here is love vast as the ocean,
 Loving kindness as the flood,
 When the Prince of life, our ransom
 Shed for us His precious blood.
 ||Who His love will not remember?
 Who can cease to sing His praise?
 He can never be forgotten
 Throughout heaven's eternal days.
 
[V2]
 On the Mount of Crucifixion
 Fountains opened deep and wide;
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
 ||Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
 Poured incessant from above,
 And heaven's peace and perfect justice
 Kissed a guilty world in love. 
  
[V3]
 "God my God", cried from the darkness
 "Why hast thou forsaken me?"
 'Twas the price for man's redemption
 Paid by Christ to set us free.
 From the deep that knows no sounding,
 Mystery of love divine,
 Swells the anthem of the ages:
 Thou are worthy Saviour mine</lyrics>
