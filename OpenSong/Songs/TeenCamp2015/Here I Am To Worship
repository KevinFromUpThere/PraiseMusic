  <lyrics>[V1]
.G            Dsus               Am
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness,
.G         Dsus         C
 Opened my eyes, let me see;
.G           Dsus      Am
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
.G         Dsus            C
 Hope of a life spent with You.

[C]
.             G                     D/F#
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,
.             G/B                C
 Here I am to say that You're my God;
.                  G                  D/F#
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
.           G/B          C
 Altogether wonderful to me.

[V2]
.G           Dsus        Am
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
.G           Dsus    C
 Glorious in Heaven above;
.G          Dsus        Am
 Humbly You came to the earth You created,
.G              Dsus        C
 All for loveâ€™s sake became poor.

[B]
.           D/F#  G/B      C
 (And) I'll never know how much it cost
.   D/F#   G/B  C
 To see my sin upon that cross.</lyrics>
