.C            F
 Search me, O God
.C            F
 And know my heart;
.C            F              G
 Know all my thoughts and my ways.
.C            F
 Cleanse me, O God,
.C            F
 Give me a pure heart,
.C            F        G
 That I may see your face.
 
[c]
.G                  F         C      (C/F   C   C/F)
 For You are an all consuming fire!
.G                  F         C      (C/F   C   C/F)
 For You are an all consuming fire!
 
[v2]
.C            F
 Teach me, O God,
.C            F
 Show me Your ways,
.C            F          G
 And I will walk in your truth.
.C            F
 Keep me, O God,
.C            F
 Keep me from falling,
.C            F          G
 That I may stand before You.

[v3]
.C            F
 Fill me, O God,
.C            F
 And send me out,
.C            F      G
 And I will make you known.
.C            F
 Give me your heart
.C            F
 And Your compassion
.C            F     G
 And let Your mercy flow.</lyrics></song>
