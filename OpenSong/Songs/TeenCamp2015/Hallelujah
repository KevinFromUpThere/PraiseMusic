  <lyrics>;CAPO 2??

[V1]
.  G                 Em
 We'll sing a song to a borrowed tune,
.     G                   Em
 Lift high our voice, sing praise to you,
.    C                  D                 G     D
 For all you've done to save us, for your glory.
.        G                  C       D
 Once dead in sin, you gave us life,
.    Em                 C              D
 Through Christ your Son, who gave his life
.    D            Bm             Em
 So we could sing eternal hallelujahs.

[C]
.     C           Em          C           G    D   G
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....

[V2]
.          G                     Em
 No greater gift we've ever known
.    G               Em
 The One who came from the Father's throne
.    C              D               G   D
 To bring rebellious sinners into glory.
.G                   C       D
 He suffered for us on the tree,
.    Em                 C    D
 He gave his life, to set us free
.    D                  Bm            Em
 From sin and death, to reign with him forever!

[V3]
.G              Em
 His body was laid in a borrowed tomb,
.     G                       Em
 But death would be beaten so very soon,
.  C                 D                   G     D
 He'd rise again, to bring God's sons to glory.
.G                          C     D
 The life we live is lived in him,
.    Em                    C       D
 No height, no depth, no power, no thing,
.       D               Bm          Em
 Can separate us from his love, forever.</lyrics>
