  <title>240 - The Master Died Upon A Cross of Shame</title>
  <lyrics>
[v1]
 The Master died upon a cross of shame;
 There we were crucified
 May we be true to His most blessed Name
 And with Him close abide.

[c]
 O Lord, our Lord, we would acknowledge Thee
 In all we say and do.
 By Thine atoning death from sin set free,
 We would to Thee be true.

[v2]
 Around this simple emblem of a grave
 We stand, to keep His word,
 Who once was buried in a hewn-out cave,
 Our risen, sovereign Lord.

[v3]
 As buried thus with Him whom we died,
 We would more like him grow;
 In all our ways be really sanctified,
 And HIM more truly know.

[v4] 
 Since now in Christ we're raised from the dead,
 Our eyes upon the throne,
 O may our thoughts aspire to Him- our Head,
 And worldly claims disown!

[v5]
