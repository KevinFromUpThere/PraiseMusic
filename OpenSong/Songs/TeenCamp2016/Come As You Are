[V1]
.A                         D               A
 Come out of sadness, From wherever you've been
.D           A            E      A
 Come broken hearted, Let rescue begin
.                      D              A
 Come find your mercy, Oh sinner come kneel
.D            A           E            F#m
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
.D            A           E            A
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal


[C]
.                 D                      A
 So Lay down your burdens, Lay down your shame
.            D                    E
 All who are broken, Lift up your face
.            D                        F#m
 Oh wanderer come home, You're not too far
.                 D                   E
 So lay down your hurt, Lay down your heart,
.            F#m
 Come as you are


[V2]
.A                              D                   A
 There's hope for the hopeless, and all that who've strayed
.D               A           E         A
 Come sit at the table, Come taste the grace
.                            D        A
 There's rest for the weary, All that endures
.D            A           E            A
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure

[B]
.            D
 Come as you are
.            F#m
 Fall in his arms
.            E
 Come as you are


[V3]
.A                            D            A
 There's joy for the morning, Oh sinner be still
.D            A           E            F#m
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
.D            A           E            A
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
