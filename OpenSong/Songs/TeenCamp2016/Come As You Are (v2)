[V1]
.G                         C               G
 Come out of sadness, From wherever you've been
.C           G            D      G
 Come broken hearted, Let rescue begin
.                      C              G
 Come find your mercy, Oh sinner come kneel
.C            G           D            Em
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal


[C]
.                 C                      G
 So Lay down your burdens, Lay down your shame
.            C                    D
 All who are broken, Lift up your face
.            C                        Em
 Oh wanderer come home, You're not too far
.                 C                   D
 So lay down your hurt, Lay down your heart,
.            Em
 Come as you are


[V2]
.G                              C                   G
 There's hope for the hopeless, and all that who've strayed
.C               G           D         G
 Come sit at the table, Come taste the grace
.                            C        G
 There's rest for the weary, All that endures
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure

[B]
.            C
 Come as you are
.            Em
 Fall in his arms
.            D
 Come as you are


[V3]
.G                            C            G
 There's joy for the morning, Oh sinner be still
.C            G           D            Em
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
.C            G           D            G
 Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal</lyrics>
