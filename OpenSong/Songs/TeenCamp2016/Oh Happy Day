 The greatest day in history,

 Death is beaten, you have rescued me,
.                        C
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive!
[v2]

 The empty cross, the empty grave,
.C                              Em
 Life eternal, you have won the day,

 He's alive!

.G
 When i stand in that place,
.C                             Em
 Free at last, meeting face to face,

 I am yours, Jesus you are mine.
.G
 Endless joy, perfect peace,
.C                          Em
 Earthly pain finally will cease

 Celebrate, Jesus is alive,
.        D
 He's alive!
