  <lyrics> 
[V1]
.           F            C
 What can I give to you?
.           G             Am
 What can I offer to the king?
.           F                   C
 For all the love you've shown,
.           F              Am
 For all your mercy over me?
 
[C]
.               F                  C
 I called your name, you heard my cry
.             F              Am
 Out of the grave, and into life
.             F                 C
 My heart is yours, my soul is free
.                     F      C
 Thank you God for saving me
.                     F      C
 Thank you God for saving me
 
[V2]
 The Rock of Salvation,
 My hope is built on nothing less
 Morning by morning
 How great is your faithfulness!
 
[B1]
 You gave your life upon a cross
 You suffered once for all
 You made a way
 Jesus in victory you rose
 You made us all your own
 Now we are saved

[B2]
 Thank you God for saving me 
      (Thank you God)
 Thank you God for saving me 
      (Thank you for the cross)
 Thank you God for saving me 
      (For saving me)
