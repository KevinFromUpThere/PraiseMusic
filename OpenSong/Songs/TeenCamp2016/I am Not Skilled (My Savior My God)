[v1]
.(C)                      C 
 I am not skilled to understand
.                                  Am7
 What God has willed, what God has planned.
.                         G
 I only know at His right hand
.                     C
 Stands One who is my Saviour.
 
[v2]
.                           C
 I take him at His word and deed.
.                               Am7
 Christ died to save me, this I read,
.                         G
 And in my heart I find a need
.                C
 of Him to be my Saviour.
 
[P]
.                                 F
 That He would leave His place on high
.                           C
 And come for sinful man to die
.                                  G
 You count it strange; so once did I
.                 C
 Before I knew my Saviour
---
 
[C]
.           Am7               F
 My Saviour loves, my Saviour lives
.             C                G
 My Saviour's always there for me.
.          Am7            F
 My God He was, my God He is,
.          C               G
 My God is always going to be.
 
[v3] 
.                         C
 Yes, living dying let me bring
.                                 Am7
 My strength, my solace from this spring
.                           G
 That He who lives to be my King
.                   C 
 Once died to be my Saviour.</lyrics></song>
