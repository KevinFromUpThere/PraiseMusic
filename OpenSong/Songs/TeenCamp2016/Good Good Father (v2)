  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                  G
 I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
.G                                        G
 But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
.      C       Bm/G                          Am7        D
 You tell me that Your pleased and that I'm never alone

[C]
.                          C
 You're a good, good father
.                   G                     Am7            D
 It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
.                    C
 And I'm loved by you
.                G               Am7            D
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

[V2]
.G                              G
 I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
.G                                   G
 But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide
.         C             Bm/G                Am7
 Because You know just what we need before we say a word


[B]
.C                              Em
 You are perfect in all of your ways 
.Am7                            G
 You are perfect in all of your ways 
.C                              Em       D
 You are perfect in all of your ways to us (repeat)

[V3]
.G                              G
 Love so undeniable I can hardly speak
.G                              G
 Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think
.           C       G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.           Am7     G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.           C       G/F#
 As You call me deeper still
.      Am7      D
 Into love love love






[T]
.                         C
 You're a good, good father
.                   G                     Am7            D
 It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
.                    C
 And I'm loved by you
.                G               Am7            D
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am</lyrics>
