<lyrics>[V1]
 REJOICE and be glad!
 The Redeemer hath come! 
 Go, look on His cradle, His cross and His tomb.
 Sound His praises, tell the story
 Of Him who was slain.
 Sound His praises, tell with gladness, 
 He liveth again!
[V2]
 Rejoice and be glad! 
 It is sunshine at last!
 The clouds have departed, 
 The shadows are past.
[V3]
 Rejoice and be glad!
 For the blood hath been shed; 
 Redemption is finished,
 The price hath been paid.
[V4]
 Rejoice and be glad! 
 Now the pardon is free! 
 The Just for the unjust 
 Hath died on the tree.
[V5]
 Rejoice and be glad!
 For the Lamb who was slain 
 O'er death is triumphant, 
 And liveth again.
[V6]
 Rejoice and be glad!
 For the Lord is on high; 
 Christ pleadeth for us
 On God's throne in the sky.
[V7]
 Rejoice and be glad! 
 For He cometh again;
  He cometh in glory, 
 The Lamb who was slain.
 Sound His praises, tell the story
 Of Him who was slain.
 Sound His praises, tell with gladness, 
 He cometh again!
