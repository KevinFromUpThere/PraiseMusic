<lyrics>[V1]
 O Blessed Saviour, is Thy love
 So vast, so full, so free?
 Fain would we give our hearts, our minds, 
 Our lives, our all, to Thee.
[V2]
 We love Thee for the glorious worth 
 Which in Thyself we see;
 We love Thee for the shameful cross, 
 Endured so patiently.
[V3]
 No man of greater love can boast 
 Than for his friend to die;
 Thou for Thine enemies wast slain;
 What love with Thine can vie?
[V4]
 Though in the very form of God, 
 With heavenly glory crowned,
 Thou didst partake of blood and flesh, 
 Beset with sorrows round.
[V5]
 Thou wouldst like sinful man be made, 
 In everything but sin,
 That we as like Thee might become, 
 As we unlike have been;
[V6]
 Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,
 In every heavenly grace; 
 From glory unto glory changed 
 Till we behold Thy face.
[V7]
 O Lord, we treasure in our hearts 
 The memory of Thy love;
 And ever may Thy name to us
 A grateful odour prove. Amen.
