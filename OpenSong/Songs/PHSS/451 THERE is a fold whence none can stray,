<title>451 ST. MATTHEW</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THERE is a fold whence none can stray,
 And pastures ever green,
 Where sultry sun or stormy sky
 Or night are never seen. 
 Far up the everlasting hills,
 In God's own light it lies; 
 His smile its vast dimension fills
 With joy that never dies.
[V2]
 There is a Shepherd living there,
 The First-born from the dead,
 Who tends with sweet, unwearied care
 The flock for which He bled.
 There soon will meet the sons of light,
 Fair as the morning sky,
 And taste of infinite delight
 Beneath the Saviour's eye.
[V3]
 There in the power of heavenly sight
 We'll gaze upon the throne,
 And scan perfection's utmost height,
 And know as we are known.
 Joy, bursting forth in strains of love
 In one harmonious song,
 Will through the heavenly courts above 
 Roll echoing along.
[V4]
 Hope's rapturous scenes inspire our song 
 While toiling here below;
 And more and more our spirits long
 Thy presence, Lord, to know! 
 Oh, take us to that blissful shore
 To sing that joyful strain,
 And from our God go out no more, 
 Nor ever weep again!
