  <title>74 MEDLEY</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Now in a song of grateful praise 
 To God we will our voices raise;
 With gladsome hearts we'll join to tell
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V2]
 All worlds His glorious power confess, 
 His wisdom all His works express,
 But, oh, His love what tongue can tell? 
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V3]
 How sovereign, wonderful and free 
 His love from all eternity!
 He plucked us from the jaws of hell; 
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V4]
 We spurned His grace, we broke His laws
 And yet He undertook our cause,
 To save us though we did rebel;
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V5]
 And when to that bright world we rise
 And sing our anthem in the skies, 
 Above the rest this note shall swell
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V6]
 And above the rest this note shall swell,
 This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
 And above the rest this note shall swell,
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
