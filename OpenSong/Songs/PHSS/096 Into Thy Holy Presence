  <title>096 Into Thy Holy Presence</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 INTO Thy holy presence,
 O God, we venture now,
 With reverent hearts and holy awe
 Before Thy throne to bow.
 We plead not our own virtues,
 They cannot here avail, 
 But by the blood of Jesus
 We enter through the veil.
 For the gift Thou gavest. 
 Thy Son from heaven above, 
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V2]
 No guilty fears assail us
 As those defiled with sin, 
 But as a holy priesthood now 
 With joy we enter in.
 Our great High Priest before us
 Has opened up the way,
 And clothed in His perfections 
 We would our homage pay.
 For the gift Thou gavest, 
 Thy Son from heaven above, 
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V3]
 Through Him our sacrifices 
 Acceptable will be,
 Though not of earthly gifts received 
 We tender unto Thee.
 To sacrifice of praises
 That unto Thee ascends,
 His blessed name and person
 An incense-fragrance lends.
 For the gift Thou gavest, 
 Thy Son from heaven above,
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V4]
 We praise Thee and we worship,
 Thou great all-loving One,
 For giving up Thy Son to death
 For sins which we had done. 
 His death and resurrection
 Have brought us nigh to Thee, 
 Now with our hearts adoring
 To Thee we bow the knee.
 For the gift Thou gavest, 
 Thy Son from heaven above,
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
