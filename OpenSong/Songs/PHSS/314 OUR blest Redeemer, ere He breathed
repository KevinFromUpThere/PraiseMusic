<lyrics>[V1]
 OUR blest Redeemer, ere He breathed 
 His tender, last farewell,
 A Guide, a Comforter bequeathed,
 With us to dwell.
[V2]
 He came in semblance of a dove,
 With sheltering wings outspread, 
 The holy balm of peace and love
 On earth to shed.
[V3]
 He came in tongues of living flame
 To teach, convince, subdue;
 All powerful as the wind He came,
 As viewless too.
[V4]
 He came sweet influence to impart,
 A gracious, willing Guest,
 Where He can find one humble heart
 Wherein to rest.
[V5]
 And His that gentle voice we hear,
 Soft as the breath of e'en, 
 That chides each fault, that calms each fear
 And speaks of heaven.
[V6]
 And every virtue we possess,
 And every victory won,
 And every thought of holiness,
 Are His alone.
[V7]
 Spirit of purity and grace,
 Our weakness pitying see;
 Oh, make our hearts Thy dwelling place, 
 And worthier Thee. Amen.
