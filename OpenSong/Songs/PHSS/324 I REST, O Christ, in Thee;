<lyrics>[V1]
 I REST, O Christ, in Thee;
  In Thee myself I hide.
 Laden with guilt and misery,
 Where could I rest beside? 
 'Tis on Thy meek and lowly breast
  My weary soul alone can rest.
[V2]
 Thou Holy One of God,
 The Father rests in Thee, 
 And in the virtue of that blood
 Which speaks to Him for me.
 The curse is gone; through Thee I'm blest
 God rests in Thee, in Thee I rest. 
[V3]
 The slave of sin and fear,
 Thy truth my bondage broke. 
 My happy spirit loves to wear
 Thy light and easy yoke.
 Thy love which fills my grateful breast 
 Makes duty joy, and labour rest.
[V4]
 Soon that bright glorious day,
 The rest of God, shall come. 
 Sorrow and sin shall pass away,
 And I shall reach my home. 
 There, of the promised land possessed, 
 My soul shall know eternal rest.
