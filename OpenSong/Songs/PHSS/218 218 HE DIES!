<lyrics>[V1]
 218 HE DIES!
 HE dies! He dies! the lowly Man of Sorrows, 
 On whom were laid our many griefs and woes; 
 Our sins He bore beneath God's awful billows, 
 And He hath triumphed over all our foes.
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
 And behold! I am alive for evermore,
 Behold! I am alive for evermore.
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead; 
 And behold! I am alive for evermore.
[V2]
 He lives! He lives! what glorious consolation! 
 Exalted at His Father's own right hand
 He pleads for us, and by His intercession 
 Enables all His saints by grace to stand.
[V3]
 He comes! He comes! Oh, blest anticipation! 
 In keeping with His true and faithful word, 
 To call us to our heavenly consummation—
 Caught up, to be for ever with the Lord.
