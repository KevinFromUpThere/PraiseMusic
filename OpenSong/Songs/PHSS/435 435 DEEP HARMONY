  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE wait the coming of our Lord,
 Nor shall this blessed hope prove vain; 
 He cannot break His faithful word, 
 That says He'll surely come again.
[V2]
 Come, then, Lord Jesus, quickly take 
 Thy people to their heavenly home; 
 Awhile they suffer for Thy sake,
 But sweet their hope of joys to come. 
[V3]
 We long to see Thee as Thou art,
 We long to mount with Thee above;
 With all Thy saints to bear our part, 
 And sing Thine everlasting love.
[V4]
 Meanwhile we glory in Thy cross,
 As Thou wast, Lord, we fain would be; 
 All earthly gain we'd count but loss, 
 And joy to share reproach with Thee.
