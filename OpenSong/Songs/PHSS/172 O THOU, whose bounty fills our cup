<lyrics>[V1]
 O THOU, whose bounty fills our cup
 With every blessing meet,
 We give Thee thanks for every drop,
 The bitter and the sweet.
[V2]
 We thank Thee for the desert road, 
 And for the riverside;
 For all Thy goodness has bestowed.
 And all Thy grace denied.
[V3]
 We thank Thee for the smile and frown, 
 And for the gain and loss;
 We bless Thee for the future crown, 
 And for the present cross.
[V4]
 We bless Thee for the glad increase,
 And for the waning joy;
 And for the calm and settled peace
 That nothing can destroy.
