<title>86 MONTGOMERY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WF hear the words of love, We gaze upon the blood,
 We see the mighty sacrifice,
 And we have peace with God: 'Tis everlasting peace.
 Sure as Jehovah's name;
 'Tis stable as His steadfast throne, For evermore the same.
[V2]
 The clouds may come and go,
 And storms may sweep our sky;
 This blood-sealed friendship changes not, The cross is ever nigh.
 Our love is of ttimes low,
 Our joy still ebbs and flows,
 But peiice with Him remains the same, No change Jehovah knows.
[V3]
 We change, He changes not; His Christ can never die;
 His love, not ours, the resting-place, His truth, not ours, the tie.
 The cross still stands unchanged, Though heaven is now His home;
 The mighty stone is rolled away, But yonder is His tomb.
[V4]
 And yonder is our peace, The grave of all our woes;
 We know the Son of God has come, We know He died and rose.
 We know He liveth now
 At God's right hand above;
 We know the throne on which He sits, We know His truth and love.
