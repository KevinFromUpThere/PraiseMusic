<lyrics>[V1]
 JEHOVAH'S my Shepherd, no want shall I know,
 He maketh me lie down where green pastures grow; 
 Beside the still waters He tenderly guides;
 My soul He restoreth by things He provides.
[V2]
 He leadeth me then, for the sake of His name,
 In paths that are righteous, to walk in the same;
 E'en though through the valley, death's shadow, I tread, 
 Because Thou art with me no ill will I dread.
[V3]
 Thou comfortest me by Thy rod and Thy staff; 
 With enemies nigh me, Thou, on my behalf, 
 Preparest a table. Then doest Thou more—
 My head Thou anointest; my cup runneth o'er.
[V4]
 I've nought, all the days of my life, to repine, 
 Since goodness and mercy shall surely be mine; 
 The house of Jehovah my dwelling shall be 
 Both now and for ever. Praise be unto Thee.
