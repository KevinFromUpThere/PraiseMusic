<lyrics>[V1]
 ID GOD, we look to Thee above, Before Thy holy throne we bow;
 We worship Thee, Thou God of love, Adoring homage bring Thee now.
[V2]
 Thou art the everlasting God, Past, present, future, still the same. Creation by Thy mighty word
 Displays the wonders of Thy name.
[V3]
 Thou triune God, there's none beside; With Thee the honour none can share. Far, far above earth's pomp and pride, With Thee none ever can compare.
[V4]
 Yet One from Thee, oh, matchless grace, Oh, wondrous mystery divine,
 In human form did take man's place, And God and man in one combine!
[V5]
 The Christ of God, in Him we see Goti's bright effulgence shining forth; And nailed upon Golgotha's tree
 A sacrifice of boundless worth.
[V6]
 And now He lives on high enthroned, Yes, now He lives no more to die. He who by death for sin atoned
 Now lives to bring His people nigh.
[V7]
 Through Him to God we now draw near, Of Him to God our praises bring.
 God for His sake will deign to hear, And to accept the songs we sing.
