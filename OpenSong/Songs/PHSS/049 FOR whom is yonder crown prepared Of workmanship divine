<title>49 DUNFERMLINE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 FOR whom is yonder crown prepared, Of workmanship divine?
 For Jesus is the bright reward,
 For Him its glories shine.
[V2]
 Beneath the earth awhile He lies,
 A Prisoner with the dead.
 A Victor soon the Lord will rise,
 And glory wreathe His head.
[V3]
 He saw the cross, despised its shame,
 And bowed beneath its weight.
 For this He bears the greatest name,
 And gains the highest seat.
[V4]
 To Him shall every knee be bowed,
 His claim shall angels own,
 Around the rising Victor croWd
 And bear Him to the throne.
[V5]
 We think we see the glorious King By hosts angelic owned;
 They shout and heaven's high arches ring With the triumphant sound.
[V6]
 Let saints on earth their tribute bring, And echo back the sound,
 For He who saves them is the King By hosts angelic owned.
