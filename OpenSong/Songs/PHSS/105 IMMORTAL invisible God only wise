<lyrics>[V1]
 IMMORTAL, invisible, God only wise,
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
[V2]
 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
 Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice like mountains high soaring above, Thy clouds are as fountains of goodness and love.
[V3]
 To all life Thou givest, to great and to small; In all life Thou livest, the true life of all.
 We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.
[V4]
 Great Father of glory, pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight; All praise we would render, Oh help us to see 'Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee.
[V5]
 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
