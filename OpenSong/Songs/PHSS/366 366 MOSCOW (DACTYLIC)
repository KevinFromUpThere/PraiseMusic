<lyrics>[V1]
 366 MOSCOW (DACTYLIC)
 THOU, whose almighty word 
 Chaos and darkness heard,
 And took their flight, 
 Hear us, we humbly pray, 
 And where the gospel day 
 Sheds not its glorious ray
 Let there be light.
[V2]
 Thou, who didst come to bring 
 On Thy redeeming wing 
 Healing and sight,
 Be pleased, Lord, to unbind 
 Sin's captives, sick in mind; 
 And to the inly blind
 Let there be light.
[V3]
 Spirit of truth and love, 
 Life-giving, holy Dove,
 Speed forth Thy flight; 
 Move on the waters' face 
 By Thine almighty grace, 
 And in earth's darkest place
 Let there be light.
[V4]
 Blessed and Holy Three, 
 Thou glorious Trinity,
 Boundless as ocean's tide 
 Rolling in fullest pride, 
 O'er the world far and wide,
 Let there be light.
