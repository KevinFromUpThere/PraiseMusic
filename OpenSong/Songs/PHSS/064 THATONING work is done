<lyrics>[V1]
 TH'ATONING work is done,
 The Victim's blood is shed,
 And Jesus now is gone
 His people's cause to plead.
 He lives in heaven, their great High Priest,
 And bears their names upon His breast.
[V2]
 He sprinkled with His blood
 The mercy-seat above, For Justice had withstood The purposes of Love.
 But Justice now withstands no more
 And Mercy yields her boundless store.
[V3]
 No temple made with hands His place of service is;
 In heaven itself He stands,
 A heavenly priesthood His;
 In Him the shadows of the law
 Are all fulfilled, and now withdraw.
[V4]
 And though awhile He be Hid from the eyes of men, His people look to see
 Their great High Priest again. In brightest glory He will come And take His waiting people home.
