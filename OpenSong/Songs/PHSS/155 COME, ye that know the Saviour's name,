<lyrics>[V1]
 COME, ye that know the Saviour's name, 
 And raise your thoughts above; 
 Let every heart and voice unite
 To sing that God is love.
[V2]
 His word this precious truth reveals, 
 And all His mercies prove; 
 Creation and redemption join
 To show that God is love.
[V3]
 His patience bearing much and long
 With those who from Him rove,
 His kindness when He leads them home,
 Attest that God is love.
[V4]
 The work begun is carried on
 By power from heaven above, 
 And every step from first to last
 Declares that God is love.
[V5]
 Oh, may we all while here below
 His perfect will approve,
 Till nobler songs in brighter worlds
 Proclaim that God is love.
