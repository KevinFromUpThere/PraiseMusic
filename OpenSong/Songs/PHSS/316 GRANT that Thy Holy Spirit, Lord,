<lyrics>[V1]
 GRANT that Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, 
 May let His beams arise,
 Dispel the darkness from our minds,
 And open all our eyes.
[V2]
 Oh may He cheer our troubled hearts, 
 That heavenly Paraclete;
 Give us to lie, in humble faith,
 At our Redeemer's feet.
[V3]
 May He revive our drooping faith,
 Our doubts and fears remove;
 And kindle in our breasts the flame
 Of never-dying love.
[V4]
 May He convince us of our guilt,
 And speak of Jesus' blood;
 And to our wondering view reveal
 The mighty love of God.
[V5]
 May He show us the Son of Man,
 Who rules the courts of bliss,
 The Lord of hosts, the Mighty God,
 Th' eternal Prince of Peace.
[V6]
 For, Lord, 't is His to cleanse the heart, 
 To sanctify the soul;
 By opening up Thy precious word, 
 To new-create the whole.
[V7]
 May He, who dwells in all our hearts, 
 Our minds from sin set free,
 That we may know and praise and love 
 One God in Persons Three.
[V14]
