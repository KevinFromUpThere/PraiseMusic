<title>24 LUCERNE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 BRIGHTNESS of th' eternal glory
 Shall His praise unuttered lie?
 Who would hush the heaven-sent story
 Of the One who came to die?
[V2]
 Came from Godhead's fullest glory
 Down to Calvary's depth of woe; Now on high, we bow before Him,
 Streams of praises ceaseless flow.
[V3]
 Sing His blest triumphant rising,
 He is on the Father's throne;
 Sing till heaven and earth surprising
 He shall reign and He alone.
 25t VESPER
 SPOTLESS Lamb by God provided!
 Here upon His face we gaze,
 Where the Father's love and glory
 Shine in all their brightest rays. His almighty power and wisdom
 All creation's works proclaim;
 Heaven and earth alike confess Him
 As the ever great I AM.
[V2]
 Lamb of God, His Father's bosom Ever was His dwelling-place; His delight, in Him rejoicing,
 One with Him in power and grace. Oh, what wondrous love and mercy Thus to lay His glory by,
 And for us to come from heaven
 As the Lamb of God to die!
[V3]
 Lamb of God, when we behold Him 
 Lowly in the manger laid,
 Wandering as a homeless Stranger 
 In the world His hands had made, 
 When we see Him in the garden. 
 Anguish forcing drops like blood, 
 At His grace we are confounded, 
 Holy, spotless Lamb of God!
[V4]
 When we see Him as the Victim
 Bound upon Golgotha's cross, For our guilt and folly stricken,
 Bearing judgment due to us,
 Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,
 He has loved us unto blood; Glory, glory everlasting
 Be unto the Lamb of God!
