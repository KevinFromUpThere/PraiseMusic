<lyrics>[V1]
 BREAK Thou the bread of life,
 Dear Lord, to me,
 As Thou didst break the bread
 Beside the sea.
 Beyond the sacred page
 I seek Thee, Lord;
 My spirit longs for Thee,
 Thou living Word.
[V2]
 Thou art the bread of life, 
 O Lord, to me;
 Thy holy word the truth 
 That saveth me.
 Give me to eat and live
 With Thee above;
 Teach me to love Thy truth, 
 For Thou art love.
[V3]
 Oh, may Thy Spirit, Lord, 
 So quicken me
 That He may touch my eyes 
 And make me see;
 Show me the truth concealed 
 Within Thy word,
 Then in Thy book revealed 
 I'll see Thee, Lord.
[V4]
 Bless Thou the bread of life 
 To me, to me,
 As Thou didst bless the loaves 
 By Galilee;
 Then shall all bondage cease, 
 All fetters fall,
 And I shall find my peace, 
 My all in all.
