<lyrics>[V1]
 CLING to the Mighty One, Cling in thy grief;
 Cling to the Holy One, He gives relief;
 Cling to the gracious One, Cling in thy pain;
 Cling to the faithful One, He will sustain.
[V2]
 Cling to the Living One,
 Cling in thy woe;
 Cling to the loving One,
 Through all below;
 Cling to the pardoning One,
 He speaketh peace; 
 Cling to the healing One, Anguish shall cease.
[V3]
 Cling to the wounded One,
 Cling to His side;
 Cling to the risen One,
 In Him abide;
 Cling to the coming One, Hope shall arise;
 Cling to the reigning One,
 Joy lights thine eyes.
