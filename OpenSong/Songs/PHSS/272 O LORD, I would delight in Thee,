<title>272 EVANGELIST</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, I would delight in Thee, 
 And on Thy care depend;
 To Thee in every trouble flee, 
 My sure, my steadfast Friend.
[V2]
 When human cisterns all are dried, 
 Thy fulness is the same;
 May I with this be satisfied,
 And glory in Thy name.
[V3]
 Why should I thirst for aught below,
 While there's a fountain near, 
 A fountain which doth ever flow,
 The fainting heart to cheer?
[V4]
 No good in creatures can be found 
 Apart, O Lord, from Thee.
 I must have all things and abound 
 Since Thou art all to me.
[V5]
 Oh, that I had but simpler faith 
 To live within the veil;
 To feed on what the Lord hath said, 
 Whose word can never fail!
[V6]
 He that hath made my heaven secure, 
 Will all I need provide.
 While Christ is rich, can I be poor—
 Christ, who for me hath died?
[V7]
 O Lord, I cast my care on Thee; 
 I triumph and adore;
 Oh, that my great concern may be
 To love and praise Thee more!
