<lyrics>[V1]
 THOUGH all the beasts that live and feed, Upon a thousand hills should bleed,
 Though all their blood should flow, The sacrifice would be in vain;
 The stain of sin would still remain; Sin is not cancelled so.
[V2]
 A better sacrifice than these
 It needs, the conscience to appease, And satisfy the Lord.
 No blood hath virtue to atone For man's offence, but His alone Whose title is the Word.
[V3]
 Jesus the Christ, on earth His name, He came, in love to sinners came,
 And bowed His head and died. A full atonement now is made,
 The ransom by His death is paid,
 And justice satisfied.
[V4]
 That sinners might draw near to Him, God planned this great, this wondrous
 And found the ransom too. [scheme, Let all the saints their voices raise,
 And sing the great Redeemer's praise,
 While endless ages flow.
