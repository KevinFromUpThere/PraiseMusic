<lyrics>[V1]
 THE sands of time are sinking,
 The dawn of heaven breaks;
 The summer morn I've sighed for,
 The fair, sweet morn awakes;
 Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
 But dayspring is at hand; 
 And glory, glory dwelleth
 In Immanuel's land!
[V2]
 There the red Rose of Sharon
 Unfolds its heartsome bloom, 
 And fills the air of heaven
 With ravishing perfume; 
 Oh, to behold its blossom,
 While by its fragrance fanned, 
 While glory, glory dwelleth
 In Immanuel's land!
[V3]
 The King there in His beauty,
 Without a veil is seen;
 It were a well-spent journey,
 Though seven deaths lay between. 
 The Lamb, with His fair army.
 Doth on mount Zion stand, 
 And glory, glory dwelleth
 In Immanuel's land! 
[V4]
 Oh Christ, He is the fountain,
 The deep, sweet well of love!
 The streams on earth I've tasted,
 More deep I'll drink above. 
 There to an ocean fulness
 His mercy doth expand, 
 And glory, glory dwelleth
 In Immanuel's land!
[V5]
 I've wrestled on toward heaven,
 'Gainst storm and wind and tide; 
 Now, like a weary traveller,
 That leaneth on his guide, 
 Amid the shades of evening,
 While sinks life's lingering sand, 
 I hail the glory dawning
 From Immanuel's land.
[V6]
 Deep waters crossed life's pathway,
 The hedge of thorns was sharp; 
 Now these lie all behind me,
 Oh, for a well-tuned harp! 
 Oh, to join Hallelujah
 With yon triumphant band, 
 Who sing, where glory dwelleth, 
 In Immanuel's land!
[V7]
 With mercy and with judgment
 My web of time He wove, 
 And aye the dews of sorrow
 Were lustred with His love. 
 I'll bless the hand that guided,
 I'll bless the heart that planned,
 When throned where glory dwelleth,
 In Immanuel's land.
[V8]
 Soon shall the cup of glory
 Wash down earth's bitterest woes; 
 Soon shall the desert's brier
 Break into Eden's rose;
 The curse shall change to blessing, 
 The name on earth that's banned 
 Be graven on the white stone
 In Immanuel's land.
[V9]
 Oh, I am my Beloved's,
 And my Beloved's mine! 
 He brings a poor vile sinner
 Into His house of wine. 
 I stand upon His merit,
 I know no safer stand,
 Not e'en where glory dwelleth,
 In Immanuel's land.
 The bride eyes not her garment,
 But her dear Bridegroom's face. 
 I will not gaze at glory,
 But on my King of grace; 
 Not at the crown He givett,
 But on His pierced hand; 
 The Lamb is all the glory
 Of Immanuel's land.
