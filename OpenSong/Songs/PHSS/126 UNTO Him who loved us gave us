<title>126 RUSSIA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 UNTO Him who loved us, gave us
 Every pledge that love could give, Freely shed His blood to save us,
 Gave His life that we might live,
 Be the kingdom
 And dominion,
 And the glory evermore. Amen. 
 O God, we adore Him
 Who once was the slain One, Now living for ever
 Enthroned in heaven. O God, we adore Him,
 For He has redeemed us; Our title to glory
 We read in His blood.
[V2]
 O God, we acknowledge The depth of Thy riches,
 For of Thee and through Thee And to Thee are all things. How rich is Thy mercy,
 How great Thy salvation!
 We bless Thee, we praise Thee;
