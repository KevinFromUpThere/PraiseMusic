<lyrics>[V1]
 ONCE in royal David's city
 Stood a lowly cattle shed,
 Where a mother laid her Baby
 In a manger for His bed;
 Mary was that mother mild, Christ the Lord her little Child.
[V2]
 He came down to earth from heaven, 
 Who is God and Lord of all;
 And His shelter was a stable,
 And His cradle was a stall;
 With the poor and mean and lowly, 
 Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
[V3]
 And through all His wondrous childhood, 
 He would honour and obey,
 Love and watch the lowly mother, 
 In whose gentle arms He lay; 
 Christian children all must be 
 Mild, obedient, good like He.
[V4]
 For He is our childhood's pattern,
 As we grow, He daily grew;
 He was little, weak, and helpless, 
 Tears and smiles like us He knew; 
 And He feeleth for our sadness, 
 And He shareth in our gladness.
[V5]
 And our eyes at last shall see Him, 
 Through His own redeeming love;
 For that Child, so meek and gentle, 
 Is our Lord in heaven above; 
 And He leads His people on
 To the place where He is gone. 
[V6]
 Not in that poor lowly stable,
 With the oxen standing by,
 We shall see Him; but in heaven, 
 Set at God's right hand on high;
 When like stars His people crowned, 
 All in white shall stand around.
