<title>26 MAN OF SORROWS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 MAN of Sorrows! what a name 
 For the Son of God, who came 
 Ruined sinners to reclaim. 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V2]
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
 In my place condemned He stood, 
 Sealed my pardon with His blood.
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V3]
 Guilty, vile, and helpless we, 
 Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
 Full atonement can it be?
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V4]
 Lifted up was He to die,
 "It is finished," was His cry, 
 Now in heaven exalted high,
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
[V5]
 When He comes, the glorious King,
 All His ransomed home to bring,
 Then anew this song we'll sing, 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
