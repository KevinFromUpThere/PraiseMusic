<lyrics>[V1]
 LET us rejoice in Christ the Lord,
 Who makes our cause His own;
 The hope that's built upon His word
 Can ne'er be overthrown.
[V2]
 Though many foes beset us round, 
 And feeble is our arm,
 Our life is hid with Christ in God, 
 Beyond the reach of harm.
[V3]
 Weak as we are we shall not faint, 
 Or, fainting, shall not fail;
 Jesus, the strength of every saint, 
 For ever must prevail.
[V4]
 Though now He's unperceived by sense, 
 Faith sees Him always near,
 A guide, a glory, a defence,
 To save from every fear.
[V5]
 As surely as He overcame,
 And conquered death and sin,
 So surely those who trust His name 
 Shall all His triumph win.
