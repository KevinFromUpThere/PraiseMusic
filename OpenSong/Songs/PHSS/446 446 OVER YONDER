<lyrics>[V1]
 446 OVER YONDER
 OH, to be over yonder,
 In that bright land of wonder,
 Where th' angel voices mingle and the angel harps do ring!
 Set free from care and sorrow,
 And th' anxious dread to-morrow,
 To rest in light and sunshine in the presence of the King.
[V2]
 Oh, to be over yonder!
 My longing heart grows fonder
 Of resting on the faithful word, until the day-star bring
 Glad tidings of th'awaking,
 Of th' cloudless, pure day breaking;
 My heart is yearning, yearning for the coming of the King.
[V3]
 Oh, to be over yonder! Alas, I sigh and ponder,
 Why clings this poor weak heart of mine to any earthly thing? 
 Each earthly tie must sever
 And pass away for ever;
 There's no more separation in the presence of the King.
