 174 OLD 29TH
 HE sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
 And He is strong to save;
 He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
 And guides each drifting wave.
 Though loud around the vessel's prow
 The waves may toss and break,
 Yet, at His word, they sink to rest,
 As on a tranquil lake.
[V2]
 He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
 When waves of sorrow rise;
 And while He holds the bitter cup
 He wipes the tearful eyes.
 He knows how long the wilful heart
 Requires the chastening grief,
 And soon as sorrow's work is done
 'Tis He who sends relief.
[V3]
 He sitteth o'er the waterfloods, 
 As in the days of old,
 When o'er the Saviour's sinless head
 The waves and billows rolled.
 Yea, all the billows passed o'er Him;
 Our sins they bore Him down;
 For us He met the crushing storm,
 He met th' Almighty's frown.
[V4]
 He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
 Then doubt and fear no more;
 For He who passed through all the storms
 Has reached the heavenly shore. 
 And every tempest-driven bark,
 With Jesus for its guide,
 Will soon be moored in harbour calm,
 In glory to abide. Amen.
