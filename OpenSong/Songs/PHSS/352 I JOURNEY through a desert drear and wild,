<title>352 NAVARRE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I JOURNEY through a desert drear and wild,
 Yet is my heart by such sweet thoughts beguiled 
 Of Him on whom I lean, my strength, my stay, 
 I can forget the sorrows of the way.
[V2]
 Thoughts of His love, the root of every grace 
 That finds in this poor heart a dwelling place; 
 The sunshine of my soul, than day more bright, 
 And my calm pillow of repose by night.
[V3]
 Thoughts of His sojourn in this vale of tears; 
 The tale of love unfolded in those years
 Of sinless suffering and patient grace,
 I love again and yet again to trace.
[V4]
 The spotless Holy One made sin for me. 
 How fathomless the love He then displayed, 
 When for my soul He full atonement made!
[V5]
 Thoughts of His glory; on the cross I gaze, 
 And there behold its sad yet healing rays; 
 Beacon of hope which, lifted up on high,
 Illumes with heavenly light the tear-dimmed eye.
[V6]
 Thoughts of His coming; for that joyful day
 In patient hope I watch and wait and pray.
 The day draws nigh, the midnight shadows flee; 
 Oh, what a sunrise will that advent be!
[V7]
 Thus while I journey on my Lord to meet, 
 My thoughts and meditations are so sweet
 Of Him on whom I lean, my strength, my stay, 
 I can forget the sorrows of the way.
