<lyrics>[V1]
 WHAT sacred fountain yonder springs
 Out from God's throne above,
 And all our covenant blessing brings?
 'Tis God's unbounded love.
[V2]
 What mighty sum paid all my debt
 When charged with guilt I stood, 
 And hath my soul at freedom set?
 'Tis Jesus' precious blood.
[V3]
 What stream of light doth now dispel 
 My terror of the rod?
 Forth from the cross my fears to quell
 Shines bright the love of God.
[V4]
 What voice is that which speaks for me
 In heaven's high court for good,
 And from the curse hath set me free?
 'Tis Jesus' precious blood.
[V5]
 What themes will fill our hearts above 
 When praise we sing to God?
 His own surpassing boundless love 
 And Jesus' precious blood.
