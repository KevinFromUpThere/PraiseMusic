<title>55 DISMISSION</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 ON the Father's throne is seated
 Christ the Lord, the Living One; All His toil on earth completed,
 All His work for sinners done.
 In the glory
 See Him, God's eternal Son.
[V2]
 Every knee shall bow before Him,
 Every tongue confess His name.
 Ransomed myriads shall adore Him
 Who endured the cross and shame.
 From the glory
 God doth now His worth proclaim.
[V3]
 Man to Him the cross awarded,
 Man the Saviour crucified;
 This world's judgment stands recorded, God's own nature glorified.
 By the glory
 Christ was claimed on earth who died.
[V4]
 Son of Man, His incarnation
 Opened first the tale of grace. Son of Man, in new creation
 Leader of a chosen race.
 Well may glory
