<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD JESUS, Friend unfailing, 
 How dear Thou art to me! 
 Are cares or fears assailing?
 I find my strength in Thee.
 Why should my feet grow weary 
 Of this my pilgrim way?
 Rough though the path and dreary, 
 It ends in perfect day.
[V2]
 Nought, nought I court as pleasure, 
 Compared, O Christ, with Thee. 
 Thy sorrow without measure
 Earned peace and joy for me.
 I love to own, Lord Jesus,
 Thy claims o'er me divine;
 Bought with Thy blood most precious, 
 Whose can I be but Thine?
[V3]
 What fills my heart with gladness?
 'Tis Thine abounding grace. 
 Where can I look in sadness,
 O Lord, but on Thy face? 
 My all is Thy providing,
 Thy love can ne'er grow cold. 
 In Thee, my refuge, hiding,
 No good wilt Thou withhold.
[V4]
 Why should I droop in sorrow? 
 Thou'rt ever by my side.
 Why, trembling, dread the morrow, 
 What ill can e'er betide?
 If I my cross have taken,
 'Tis but to follow Thee;
 If scorned, despised, forsaken,
 Nought severs Thee from me.
[V5]
 O worldly pomp and glory,
 Your charms are spread in vain. 
 I've heard a sweeter story,
 I've found a truer gain. 
 Where Christ a place prepareth,
 There is my loved abode,
 There shall I gaze upon Him,
 There ever dwell with God.
[V6]
 For every tribulation,
 For every sore distress,
 In Christ I've full salvation, 
 Sure help and quiet rest.
 No fear of foes prevailing, 
 I triumph, Lord, in Thee.
 Lord Jesus, Friend unfailing, 
 How dear Thou art to me!
