<lyrics>[V1]
 'TB we, O God, whom Thou hast shown The deadly bitterness of sin,
 We, who forgiving love have known, May fitly bring thank-offerings in.
[V2]
 Thy presence called for Israel's praise, Encompassed by their mortal foes; And when in death they met their gaze What songs of glorious triumph rose!
[V3]
 And we have known redemption, Lord, From bondage worse than theirs by far; Sin held us by a stronger cord,
 Yet by Thy mercy free we are.
[V4]
 The blest Redeemer's groans and tears, His death the power of darkness broke; Bursting the chains we wore for years He freed us from the iron yoke.
[V5]
 Divine Deliverer! He alone
 Thy people from the deep could bring; The glorious triumph all His ownï¿½
 His name, His might, His grace we sing.
[V5]
