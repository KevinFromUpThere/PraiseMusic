<lyrics>[V1]
 280 SOMETHING FOR THEE
 SAVIOUR, Thy dying love 
 Thou gavest me;
 Nor should I aught withhold,
 My Lord, from Thee.
 In love my soul would bow,
 My heart fulfil its vow, 
 Some offering bring Thee now,
 Something for Thee.
[V2]
 At the blest mercy-seat
 'Pleading for me—
 My feeble faith looks up,
 O Lord, to Thee;
 Help me the cross to bear,
 Thy wondrous love declare, 
 Some song to raise, or prayer,
 Something for Thee.
[V3]
 Give me a faithful heart,
 Likeness to Thee,
 That each departing day
 Henceforth may see
 Some work of love begun,
 Some deed of kindness done,
 Some wanderer sought and won—
 Something for Thee.
[V4]
 All that I am and have—
 Thy gifts so free—
 In joy, in grief, through life, 
 O Lord, for Thee!
 And when Thy face I see
 My ransomed soul shall be 
 Through all eternity
 Something for Thee.
