<lyrics>[V1]
 225 DUKE STREET
 WHERE high the heavenly temple stands, 
 The house of God not made with hands, 
 A great High Priest true manhood wears, 
 And there before our God appears.
[V2]
 He, who for us as surety stood,
 Yielding on earth His precious blood, 
 Pursues in heaven His gracious plan, 
 The Saviour and the Friend of man.
[V3]
 Partaker of the human name,
 He knows the frailty of our frame,
  And still remembers in the skies 
 His tears and griefs and agonies.
[V4]
 In every pang that rends the heart 
 The Man of Sorrows bears a part; 
 He knows and feels our every grief, 
 And gives the suffering saint relief.
[V5]
 With boldness therefore at the throne 
 Let us make all our sorrows known,
  And seek the aid of heavenly power 
 To help us in each trying hour.
