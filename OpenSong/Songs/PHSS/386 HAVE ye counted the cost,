<lyrics>[V1]
 HAVE ye counted the cost,
 Ye warriors of the cross?
 Are ye fixed in your heart for the Master's sake
 To suffer all earthly loss?
 Can ye bear the scoff of the worldly wise,
 As ye pass by pleasure's bower,
 To watch with the Lord on the mountain top
 Through the dreary midnight hour? 
[V2]
 Ye may drink of His cup,
 And in His baptism share.
 Ye shall not fail, if ye tread in His steps,
 His blood-stained cross to bear.
 But count ye the cost, oh count ye the cost,
 That ye be not unprepared;
 And know ye the strength that alone can stand
 In the conflict ye have dared.
[V3]
 In the power of His might,
 Who was made through weakness strong
 Ye shall overcome in the fearful fight 
 And sing His victory song.
 By the blood of the Lamb, by the blood of the Lamb,
 By the faithful witness word,
 Not loving your lives unto death for Him,
 Ye shall triumph with your Lord.
[V4]
 Oh, the banner of love,
 It will cost you a pang to hold.
 But 'twill float in triumph the field above, 
 Though your hearts' blood stain its fold.
 Ye may count the cost, ye may count the cost
 Of all of Egypt's gold,
 But the riches of Christ ye cannot count,
  His love cannot be told.
