  <title>018 The Author of Salvation</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE Author of salvation 
 Was offered on the tree,
 His deep humiliation
 In symbol here we see.
 We, by the Spirit guided,
 To Golotha repair;
 The Lamb that God provided 
 Was slaughtered for us there.
[V2]
 The sword of God was bidden
 His Holy One to smite,
 Jehovah's face was hidden
 In terrors from His sight.
 God's tokens had declared Him
 His Son who pleased Him well;
 He pierced His soul, nor spared Him
 When bruised by earth and hell.
[V3]
 Justice, our guilt to cover, 
 Awoke the wrathful storm;
 Dismay seized friend and lover,
 He said, "I am a worm."
 He was of God forsaken,
 As One by God abhorred,
 The sinner's place was taken 
 By Him our glorious Lord.
[V4]
 His God who duly prized Him,
 Whose statutes He did keep,
 In floods of death baptized Him,
 In sorrow's lowest deep.
 He was the Father's treasure, 
 The Christ whom He had sent; 
 His righteous sore displeasure
 On Him for us was spent.
[V5]
 We on to ruin hurried,
 To misery's abyss,
 But dead with Him and buried,
 And raised to share His bliss, 
 We sing with hearts united
 His cross for evermore;
 Once like the world benighted,
 His name we now adore. Amen.
