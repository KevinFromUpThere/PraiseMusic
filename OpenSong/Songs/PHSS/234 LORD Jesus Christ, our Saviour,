<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus Christ, our Saviour, 
 We only look to Thee;
 'Tis in Thy love and favour
 Our souls find liberty.
 Whilst Satan fiercely rages
 And shipwreck oft we fear, 
 'Tis this our grief assuages,
 That Thou art always near.
[V2]
 Yea, though the tempest round us 
 Seems safety to defy,
 Though rocks and shoals surround us,
 And swell the billows high,
 Thou dost through all protect us
 And cheer us by Thy love; 
 Thy counsels too direct us.
 Safe to the rest above.
[V3]
 There with what joy reviewing
 Past conflicts, dangers, fears, 
 Thy hand our foes subduing,
 And drying all our tears;
 Our hearts with rapture burning,
 The path we shall retrace,
 Where now our souls are learning
 The riches of Thy grace.
[V4]
 Oh, then how loud the chorus
 Shall to Thy name resound, 
 From all at rest before us,
 From all Thy grace hath found! 
 One joyful song for ever
 Each heart, each lip, shall raise—
 The praise of our Redeemer,
 Our God and Saviour's praise!
