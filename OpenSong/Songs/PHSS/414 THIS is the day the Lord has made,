  <lyrics>[V1]
 THIS is the day the Lord has made, 
 In it He has His grace displayed. 
 'Tis ours to sing in holy lays,
 For all His love, our grateful praise.
[V2]
 O Lord, for all the days gone by, 
 Thy name we gladly magnify;
 For Thou hast brought us to Thine hill, 
 Thy purpose, Lord, here to fulfil.
[V3]
 Within Thy house, in number few, 
 We seek Thy grace Thy will to do. 
 Lord, of ourselves we're very weak; 
 Thy help and strength we humbly seek.
[V4]
 The future, Lord, we do not know, 
 But seek that we in grace may grow, 
 To meet what comes in simple faith, 
 Believing what the Scripture saith.
[V5]
 For those who in Jehovah trust, 
 Triumph they will and triumph must. 
 Lord God Almighty, Thou our rock, 
 Wilt surely save Thy little flock.
[V6]
 Oh, quickly send the coming day
 When we shall leave these clods of clay; 
 With those in Christ raised from the dead, 
 We'll join with joy our glorious Head.
