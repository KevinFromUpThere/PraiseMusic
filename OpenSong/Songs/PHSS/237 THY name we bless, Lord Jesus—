<lyrics>[V1]
 THY name we bless, Lord Jesus—
 That name all names excelling.
 How great Thy love 
 (All praise above) 
 Should every tongue be telling. 
 The Father's loving kindness 
 In giving Thee was shown us,
 Now by Thy blood
 Redeemed to God, 
 As children He doth own us.
[V2]
 From that eternal glory
 Thou hadst with God the Father,
 He sent His Son
 That He in one
 His people all might gather. 
 Our sins were all laid on Thee,
 God's wrath Thou hast endured;
 It was for us
 Thou suffer'dst thus, 
 And hast our peace secured.
[V3]
 Thou from the dead wast raised, 
 And from all condemnation
 The Church is free,
 As raised in Thee, 
 Head of the new creation. 
 On high Thou hast ascended 
 To God's right hand in heaven;
 The Lamb once slain
 Alive again,
 To Thee all power is given.
[V4]
 Thou hast bestowed the earnest 
 Of that we shall inherit;
 Till Thou shalt come 
 To take us home
 We're sealed by God the Spirit. 
 We wait for Thine appearing, 
 When we shall know more fully
 The grace divine
 That made us Thine, 
 Thou Lamb of God most holy.
