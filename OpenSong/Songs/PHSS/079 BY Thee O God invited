  <lyrics>[V1]
 BY Thee, O God, invited
 We look unto the Son,
 In whom Thy soul delighted,
 Who all Thy will hath done;
 And by the one chief treasure
 Thy bosom freely gave,
 Thine own pure love we measure,
 Thy willing mind to save.
[V2]
 O gracious God the Father,
 The one unchanging claim,
 The brightest hopes we gather
 From Christ's most precious name. 
 What always sounds so sweetly
 In Thine unwearied ear,
 Hath freed our souls completely From all our sinful fear.
[V3]
 The trembling sinner feareth
 That God can ne'er forget, 
 But one full payment cleareth
 His mem'ry of all debt.
 When nought beside could ease us
 Or set our souls at large, 
 The precious blood of Jesus Secured a full discharge.
[V4]
 No wrath God's heart retaineth
 To usward who believe;
 No dread in ours remaineth,
 As we His love receive. 
 Returning ones He kisses,
 And with His robe invests, 
 His perfect love dismisses
 All terror from our breasts.
