<lyrics>[V1]
 ROCK of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee! 
 Let the water and the blood,
 From Thy riven side which flowed, 
 Be of sin the double cure,
 Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
[V2]
 Not the labour of my hands
 Could fulfil the law's demands; 
 Could my zeal no respite know, 
 Could my tears for ever flow, 
 All for sin could not atone;
 Thou must save, and Thou alone.
[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring, 
 Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
 Naked, come to Thee for dress, 
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace; 
 Hungry, thirsty still I flee, 
 All-sufficient Lord, to Thee.
[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath,
 Should mine eyelids close in death; 
 When I soar to worlds unknown, 
 And behold Thee on Thy throne; 
 Rock of ages, cleft for me,
 Still I hide myself in Thee!
