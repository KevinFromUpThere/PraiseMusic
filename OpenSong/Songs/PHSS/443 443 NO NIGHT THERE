  <lyrics>[V1]
 443 NO NIGHT THERE
 IN the land of fadeless day
 Lies "the city four-square;"
  It shall never pass away,
 And there is "no night there."
[C]
 God shall wipe away all tears; 
 There's no death or pain or fears; 
 And they count not time by years, 
 For there is "no night there."
[V2]
 All the gates of pearl are made
 In" the city four-square;" 
 All the street with gold is laid,
 And there is "no night there."
[V3]
 And the gates shall never close
 To "the city four-square;"
 There life's crystal river flows,
 And there is "no night there."
[V4]
 There they need no sunshine bright 
 In "the city four-square; "
 For the Lamb is all the light,
 And there is "no night there."
