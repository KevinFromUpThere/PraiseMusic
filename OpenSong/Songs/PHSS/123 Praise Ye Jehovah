  <title>123 Praise Ye Jehovah</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 PRAISE ye Jehovah, praise the Lord most holy,
 Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak;
 Praise Him who will with glory crown the lowly,
 And with salvation beautify the meek.
 Praise ye the Lord for all His loving-kindness,
 And all the tender mercies He has shown;
 Praise Him who pardons all our sins and blindness, 
 And calls us sons and takes us for His own.
[C]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 On this Lordly morn our song we raise to Thee;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[V2]
 Praise ye Jehovah, source of every blessing,
 Viewed with His gifts, earth's brightest boons are dim; 
 Resting on Him, His peace and joy possessing,
 All things are ours, for we have all in Him.
 Praise ye the Father, God the Lord, who gave us
 With full and perfect love His only Son;
 Praise ye the Son, who died Himself to save us;
 Praise ye the Spirit; praise the Three in One.
[C2]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 On this Lordly morn our song we raise to Thee;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity. Amen.
