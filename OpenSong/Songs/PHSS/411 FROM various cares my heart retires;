<lyrics>[V1]
 FROM various cares my heart retires;
 Though deep and boundless its desires,
 I've now to please but One;
 Him to whom every knee shall bow, 
 With Him is all my business now,
 And those that are His own.
[V2]
 With these my happy lot is cast,
 Through the world's deserts rude and waste
 Or through its gardens fair; 
 Whether the storms of trouble sweep, 
 Or all in dead supineness sleep,
 T' advance be all my care.
[V3]
 O Lord, my way, my truth, my life, 
 Henceforth let sorrow, doubt and strife
 Drop off like autumn leaves. 
 Henceforth, as privileged by Thee, 
 Simple and undistracted be
 My soul, which to Thee cleaves.
[V4]
 Let me my feebleness recline
 On that eternal love of Thine,
 And human thoughts forget;
 Childlike attend what Thou wilt say,
 Go forth and serve Thee while 'tis day,
 Nor leave my sweet retreat.
