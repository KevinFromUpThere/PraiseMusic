<title>20 MUNICH</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 No bone of Him was brokenï¿½The spotless paschal Lamb; Of life and peace a token
 To us who know His name. The Head for all the members
 The curse, the vengeance bore, And God, our God, remembers
 His people's sins no more.
[V2]
 That countenance transcendent, That life-creating Sun
 To worlds on Him dependent,
 Was bruised and spit upon! That which His soul tormented
 Was our sins' heavy load, We had the debt augmented
 Which He then paid in blood.
[V3]
 And oh! what consolation
 Doth in our hearts take place, When we His toil and passion Can joyfully retrace.
 Ah! should we while thus musing On our Redeemer's cross,
 E'en life itself be losing,
 Great gain would be that loss.
[V4]
 We give Thee thanks unfeigned
 For Him the Friend in need, For what His soul sustained
 When He for us did bleed. And now we rest unshaken
 Upon His faithfulness,
 Until we hence are taken
 To see Him face to face. 
 We, the redeemed, are reaping
 What Christ did sow in tears, The feast which we are keeping
 His name to us endears. It tells of Justice hiding
 From Him the face of God, Proud men around deriding
 His sorrow's awful load.
[V5]
 His death of shame and sorrow
 Was like unto His birth,
 Which would no glory borrow,
 No majesty from earth. As pilgrims we are hasting
 To our eternal home, Its joy already tasting
 Of victory o'er the tomb.
[V6]
 His life and death reviewing,
 We tread the narrow way;
 Our homeward path pursuing,
 We watch the dawn of day.
 We eat and drink with gladness
 The broken bread and wine, And sing with sweetest sadness
 Our song of love divine.
