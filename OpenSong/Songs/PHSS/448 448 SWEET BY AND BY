<lyrics>[V1]
 448 SWEET BY AND BY
 THERE'S a land that is fairer than day, 
 And by faith we can see it afar,
 For the Saviour waits over the way, 
 To prepare us a dwelling place there.
 In the sweet by-and-by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[V2]
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
 The melodious songs of the blest; 
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
[V3]
 To our bountiful Father above
 We will offer the tribute of praise, 
 For the glorious gift of His love,
 And the blessings that hallow our days.
