<lyrics>[V1]
 Now in a song of grateful praise To God we will our voices raise;
 With gladsome hearts we'll join to tellï¿½Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V2]
 All worlds His glorious power confess, His wisdom all His works express,
 But, oh, His love what tongue can tell? Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V3]
 How sovereign, wonderful and free His love from all eternity!
 He plucked us from the jaws of hell; Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V4]
 We spurned His grace, we broke His And yet He undertook our cause, [laws, To save us though we did rebel;
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
[V5]
 And when to that bright world we rise And sing our anthem in the skies, Above the rest this note shall swellï¿½Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
 Chorus at the end of the hymn
 And above the rest
 This note shall swellï¿½
 Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
