  <lyrics>[V1]
 HOW deep and grievous was the woe
 Of Christ upon the cross!
 It laid the mighty Saviour low
 When hanging there for us.
 To bring us gain He bare the pain,
 And suffered shame and loss.
[V2]
 The wage of sin was in our cup,
 Wrath filled it to the brim;
 Its bitterness we'll never sup,
 That cup was drunk by Him. 
 'Twas all for us He suffered thus, 
 That we might live through Him.
[V3]
 There rose a keen relentless storm, 
 It burst on Christ alone;
 It marred His visage and His form,
 But thus He saved His own. 
 He bore the grief for our relief,
 Unaided and alone.
[V4]
 Jehovah's righteous anger dire
 Fell on His only Son;
 He bare the brunt of all God's ire,
 And thus our peace was won.
 The stripes were sore the Saviour bore; 
 God spared not His Son.
[V5]
 His wrathful sword was raised to smite
 The One who pleased Him well; 
 On Him in whom He had delight
 The bitter chastening fell.
 Our peace He made, the price He paid; 
 His love no tongue can tell.
[V6]
 It was for us Christ Jesus died, 
 A Victim on the cross,
 Revealing thus the boundless tide 
 Of love He has to us.
 He is our Lord alone adored 
 Who died upon the cross.
[V7]
 The One who suffered grief and shame 
 Is raised and glorified.
 We sing the triumph of His name
 Who groaned and bled and died. 
 We celebrate His triumph great;
 He's raised and glorified.
