 190 GOD HOLDS THE KEY
 GOD holds the key of all unknown,
 And I am glad;
 If other hands should hold the key, 
 Or if He trusted it to me,
 I might be sad. 
[V2]
 What if tomorrow's cares were here,
 Without its rest!
 I'd rather He unlock the day,
 And, as the hours swing open, say,
 "My will is best."
[V3]
 The very dimness of my sight 
 Makes me secure;
 For, groping in my misty way, 
 I feel His hand, I hear Him say,
 "My help is sure."
[V4]
 I cannot read His future plans,
 But this I know—
 I have the smiling of His face, 
 And all the refuge of His grace,
 While here below.
[V5]
 Enough! this covers all my wants,
 And so I rest.
 For what I cannot, He can see, 
 And in His care I saved shall be, 
 For ever blest.
