<lyrics>[V1]
 OH happy day, when first we felt
 Our souls with deep contrition melt, 
 And saw our sins of crimson guilt,
 All cleansed by blood on Calvary spilt!
[V2]
 Oh happy day, when first Thy love 
 Began our grateful hearts to move; 
 And, gazing on Thy wondrous cross, 
 We saw all else as worthless dross!
[V3]
 Oh happy day, oh blessed hour,
 When by the Spirit's gentle power, 
 We sing to God with one accord 
 In praise of Jesus Christ our Lord!
[V4]
 Oh happy day, whene'er we know 
 The joy of God down here below! 
 Though sorrow, grief and woe assail, 
 His power and love can never fail.
[V5]
 Oh happy day, when we no more
 Shall grieve Thee whom our souls adore 
 When sorrows, conflicts, fears shall cease 
 And all our trials end in peace.
[V6]
 Oh happy day, when we shall see 
 And fix our longing eyes on Thee; 
 On Thee, our light, our life, our love, 
 Our all below, our heaven above!
[V7]
 Oh happy day of cloudless light, 
 Eternal day without a night!
 Lord, when shall we its dawning see, 
 And spend it all in praising Thee?
[V8]
 Come, Saviour, come, oh quickly come, 
 Take us Thy waiting people home;
 We long to stand around Thy throne 
 And know Thee as by Thee we're known.
