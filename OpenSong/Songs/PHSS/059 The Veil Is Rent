  <title>059 The Veil Is Rent</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE veil is rent! Lo, Jesus sits
 Upon a throne of grace;
 The incense which His name emits
 Fills all that glorious place.
[V2]
 His precious blood is sprinkled there 
 Before and on the throne,
 And His own wounds in heaven declare 
 His work on earth is done.
[V3]
 "'Tis finished," on the cross He said 
 In agonies and blood;
 "'Tis finished," now He lives to plead 
 Before the face of God.
[V4]
 "'Tis finished," here our souls can rest, 
 His work can never fail;
 By Him, our sacrifice and Priest,
 We enter through the veil.
[V5]
 Within the Holiest of all,
 Cleansed by His precious blood, 
 Before Thy throne Thy people fall 
 And worship Thee, O God.
[V6]
 Boldly our heart and voice we raise, 
 His name, His blood, our plea, 
 Assured our sacrifice of praise
 Ascends by Him to Thee.
