<lyrics>[V1]
 Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, 
 That firm remains on high
 The e?erlasting throne of Him
 Who formed the earth and sky? 
[V2]
 Art thou afraid His power shall fail
 When comes thine evil day?
 And can an all-creating arm
 Grow weary or decay?
[V3]
 Supreme in wisdom as in power
 The Rock of ages stands,
 Though Him thou canst not see, nor trace 
 The working of His hands.
[V4]
 He gives the conquest to the weak, 
 Supports the fainting heart; 
 And courage in the evil hour
 His heavenly aids impart.
[V5]
 Mere human power shall fast decay, 
 And youthful vigour cease;
 But they who wait upon the Lord
 In strength shall still increase.
[V6]
 They with unwearied feet shall tread 
 The path of life divine,
 With growing ardour onward move,
 With growing brightness shine.
