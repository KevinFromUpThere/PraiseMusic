 216 PASSION CHORALE
 O SACRED Head once wounded,
 With grief and pain weighed down, 
 How scornfully surrounded
 With thorns, Thine only crown! 
 How art Thou pale with anguish,
 With sore abuse and scorn!
 How does that visage languish,
 Which once was bright as morn!
[V2]
 O sacred Head, what glory,
 What bliss till now was Thine! 
 Yet, though despised and gory,
 I joy to call Thee mine.
 Thy grief and Thy compassion
 Were all for sinners' gain;
 Mine, mine was the transgression,
 But Thine the deadly pain.
[V3]
 What language shall I borrow,
 To praise Thee, heavenly Friend, 
 For this Thy dying sorrow,
 Thy pity without end?
 Lord, I am Thine for ever,
 Ne'er let me faithless prove; 
 Oh, let me never, never,
 Forget such dying love! Amen.
