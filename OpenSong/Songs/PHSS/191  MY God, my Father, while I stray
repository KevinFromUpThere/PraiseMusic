<title>191 MEMORIA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
  MY God, my Father, while I stray 
 Far from my home on life's rough way, 
 Oh teach me from my heart to say,
 "Thy will be done."
[V2]
 Though dark my path or sad my lot, 
 Let me be still, and murmur not,
 But breathe the prayer divinely taught,
 "Thy will be done."
[V3]
 What though in lonely grief I sigh 
 For friends beloved, no longer nigh? 
 Submissive still would I reply,
 "Thy will be done."
[V4]
 If Thou shouldst call me to resign 
 What most I prize, it ne'er was mine;
 I only yield Thee what is Thine; 
 Thy will be done.
[V5]
 If but my fainting heart be blest 
 With Thy good Spirit for my Guest, 
 My God, to Thee I'll leave the rest;
 Thy will be done.
[V6]
 Renew my will from day to day, 
 Blend it with Thine, and take away 
 All that now makes it hard to say,
 "Thy will be done."
[V7]
 And when on earth I breathe no more 
 The prayer oft mixed with tears before, 
 I'll sing upon a happier shore,
 "Thy will be done." Amen.
