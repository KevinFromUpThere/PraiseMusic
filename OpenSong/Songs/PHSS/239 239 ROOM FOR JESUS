 239 ROOM FOR JESUS
  SON of God, 'twas love that made Thee
 Die, our ruined souls to save;
 'Twas our sins' vast load that laid Thee,
 Lord of life, within the grave. 
 But Thy glorious resurrection
 Showed Thee conqueror o'er the tomb; 
 So the saints, by Thy protection,
 Through Thy work shall overcome.
[V2]
 Thou to heaven hast now ascended,
 Entering there by Thine own blood, 
 All Thy work of suffering ended,
 Fully wrought the will of God.
 For Thy saints Thou still art caring,
 For us pleading in Thy love, 
 And our place of rest preparing
 In the Father's house above.
[V3]
 Now the Paraclete doth gather
 To Thy name Thy people here; 
 So we worship God the Father,
 Serve in love and holy fear.
 What a debt of love we owe Thee,
 Love that we can ne'er express,
 Since we through the Spirit know Thee,
 Christ the Lord, our righteousness!
