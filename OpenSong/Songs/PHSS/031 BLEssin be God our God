  <lyrics>[V1]
 BLESSED be God, our God,
 Who gave for us His well-beloved Son, 
 The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one; 
 Blessed be God, our God!
[V2]
 What will He not bestow,
 Who gave for us this mighty gift unbought, 
 Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought? 
 What will He not bestow?
[V3]
 He spared not His Son!
 'Tis this that silences each rising fear,
 'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
 He spared not His Son!
[V4]
 Who shall condemn us now,
 Since Christ has died and risen and gone above, 
 For us to plead at the right hand of Love? 
 Who shall condemn us now?
[V5]
 'Tis God that justifies!
 Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
 Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
 'Tis God that justifies!
[V6]
 The victory is ours!
 For us in might came forth the Mighty One;
 For us He fought the fight, the triumph won; 
 The victory is ours!
