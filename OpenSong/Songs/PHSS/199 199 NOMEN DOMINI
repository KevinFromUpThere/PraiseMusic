 199 NOMEN DOMINI
 GOD the Unsearchable, mighty and great,
 Thou, who the heavens and the earth didst create, 
 Known to the Hebrews as true Elohim, 
 Worshipped, adored by six-winged seraphim; 
 Christ bore our sins when He died on the tree, 
 Bringing us nigh by His death unto Thee.
[V2]
 Timeless and endless, th'eternal I AM, 
 Infinite, holy; Jehovah Thy name; 
 Glorious name of th'Ineffable Three, 
 Changeless Jehovah we bow before Thee. 
 Father and Spirit and Son evermore, 
 Triune Jehovah we humbly adore.
[V3]
 Rich, all possessing, our Lord, Adonai,
 Owner of earth and of sea and of sky,
 Ever and ever Thy name be adored,
 Wealthy possessor of all things, our Lord. 
 Christ, who redeemed us from sin and the Fall, 
 Taught us the Lord as our Father to call.
[V4]
 Jah is Thy wondrous, mysterious name; 
 By it we hail Thee, Thy glory acclaim.
 Jah is Thy name, O Thou Ancient of days, 
 Solemnly sing we Thine infinite praise. 
 Glorious the knowledge of fatherly love 
 Brought to our hearts by the heavenly Dove.
[V5]
 El, Thou Almighty, Thou powerful and strong, 
 (Strength for Thy people the whole way along); 
 Humbly we bow and acknowledge Thy claim, 
 Mighty unsearchable God is Thy name.
 Christ, who redeemed us from sin and the Fall, 
 Taught us this God as our Father to call.
