 431 MOOR WOOD
 MIDST the darkness, storm and sorrow, 
 One bright gleam I see—
 Well I know the blessed morrow,
 Christ will come for me.
 Midst the light and peace and glory 
 Of the Father's home,
 Christ for me is watching, waiting, 
 Waiting till I come.
[V2]
 Long the blessed Guide has led me 
 By the desert road;
 Now I see the golden towers,
 City of my God;
 There amidst the love and glory, 
 He is waiting yet;
 On His hands a name is graven,
 He can ne'er forget.
[V3]
 There amidst the songs of heaven, 
 Sweeter to His ear
 Is the footfall through the desert, 
 Ever drawing near.
 There made ready are the mansions,
 Glorious, bright and fair,
 But the Bride the Father gave Him 
 Still is wanting there.
[V4]
 Who is This who comes to meet me 
 On the desert way,
 As the morning star foretelling
 God's unclouded day?
 He it is who came to save me,
 On the cross of shame;
 In His glory well I know Him,
 Evermore the same.
[V5]
 Oh, the blessed joy of meeting,
 All the desert past!
 Oh, the wondrous words of greeting
 He shall speak at last! 
 He and I together entering
 Those bright courts above; 
 He and I together sharing
 All the Father's love!
[V6]
 Where no shade nor stain can enter,
 Nor the gold be dim; 
 In that holiness unsullied,
 I shall walk with Him;
 Meet companion for the Master,
 From Him, for Him made; 
 Glory of God's grace for ever,
 There in me displayed!
[V7]
 He, who in the hour of sorrow
 Bare the cross alone;
 I, who through the lonely desert
 Trod where He had gone; 
 He and I in that bright glory
 One deep joy shall share—
 Mine to be for ever with Him,
 His that I am there.
