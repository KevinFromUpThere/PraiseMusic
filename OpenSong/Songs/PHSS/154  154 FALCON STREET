  <lyrics>[V1]
 GRACE! 'tis a charming sound, 
 Harmonious to the ear;
 Heaven with the echo shall resound,
 And all the earth shall hear.
[V2]
 Grace first contrived the way 
 To save rebellious man,
 And all the steps that grace display 
 Which drew the wondrous plan.
[V3]
 In life's eternal book;
 'Twas grace that gave us to the Lamb,
 Who all our sorrows took.
[V4]
 Grace taught our wandering feet
 To tread the heavenly road;
 And new supplies each hour we meet
 While travelling home to God.
[V5]
 Grace taught us how to pray, 
 And made our eyes o'erflow;
 'Tis grace has kept us to this day,
 And will not let us go.
[V6]
 May grace, free grace, inspire 
 Our souls with strength divine;
 May all our thoughts to God aspire,
 And grace in service shine.
[V7]
 Grace all the work shall crown 
 Through everlasting days;
 It lays in heaven the topmost stone,
 And well deserves the praise.
 Chorus at the end of the hymn.
 Praise ye the Lord, Hallelujah!
 Praise ye the Lord.
