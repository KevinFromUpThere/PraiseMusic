<lyrics>[V1]
 PEACE, peace, calm as a river;
 Peace, peace, deep as the sea; 
 Peace, peace, lasting for ever, 
 Made upon Golgotha's tree.
 Peace, peace, great peace! 
 Made upon Golgotha's tree.
[V2]
 Rest, rest, ne'er to be broken;
 Rest, rest, Christ hath it spoken; 
 Rest in Himself only found.
 Rest, rest, sweet rest! 
 Rest in Himself only found.
[V3]
 Joy, joy, ever abiding;
 Joy, joy, perfect and sure; 
 Joy which shall ever endure.
 Joy, joy, glad joy! 
 Joy which shall ever endure.
[V4]
 Home, home, glorious dwelling;
 Home, home, Jesus is there. 
 Bliss, bliss, passing all telling,
 Soon all the ransomed will share.
 Home, home, sweet home! 
 Soon all the ransomed will share.
