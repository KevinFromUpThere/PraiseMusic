<title>66 MARINERS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 RISE, each soul, behold, 'tis Jesus! Jesus fills our wondering eyes; See Him now in glory seated
 Where our sins no more can rise.
[V2]
 There in righteousness transcendent,
 Lo, He doth in heaven appear!
 Shows the blood of His atonement
 As our title to be there.
[V3]
 All our sins were laid upon Him,
 Jesus bore them on the tree;
 God, who knew them, laid them on Him, And, believing, we are free.
[V4]
 God now brings us to His dwelling, Spreads for us a feast of love, Bids us welcome, ever telling
 What our portion is above.
[V5]
 In that circle of God's favour,
 Circle of the Father's love, All is rest, and rest for ever,
 All is perfectness above.
[V6]
 Blessed, glorious word " for ever,"
 Yes, " for ever " is the word; Nothing can the ransomed sever,
 Nought divide them from the Lord.
[V3]
