 206 SONG OF THE BRIDE
  GENTLENESS and tender feeling, 
 Pity too and grace,
 Softly lustred all Thy dealing
 With our stricken race.
 Thou with sympathy and healing
 Mid our woes didst move, 
 Every gracious deed revealing
 Thou, O Lord, art love.
[V2]
 E'en when in Thy poignant anguish, 
 Dying on the tree,
 When men left Thee there to languish, 
 Full of hate to Thee,
 When our sins and judgment bearing, 
 Smitten from above,
 Every cry was then declaring,
 Thou, O Lord, art love.
[V3]
 Seated in triumphant glory
 On the Father's throne,
 Still we read the self-same story
 That on earth was known; 
 Changeless in Thy holy dwelling
 Thou dost ever prove;
 There Thy wound-prints aye are telling
 Thou, O Lord, art love. 
[V4]
 Thou, Lord, in Thy heart's affection
 Pleadest for us there;
 Knowing well our imperfection,
 Thou our woes canst share;
 Thou canst succour in temptation,
 Strengthen from above,
 Comfort give and consolation;
 Thou, O Lord, art love.
[V5]
 Payment meet for all we owe Thee,
 We, O Lord, have none;
 But we long still more to know Thee
 Who our hearts hast won.
 May we here, Thy love compelling,
 Ever grateful prove;
 Walk and word and action telling,
 Thou, O Lord, art love.
[V6]
 Soon, enraptured we shall meet Thee; 
 Thou for us wilt come;
 Face to face with joy we'll greet Thee
 In that heavenly home.
 There, where angel-throngs are praising, 
 We with Thee shall move,
 This eternal anthem raising, 
 Thou, O Lord, art love.
