  <title>101 We Come With Hearts Obedient</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE come with hearts obedient,
 Our God, to worship Thee;
 The symbols we have taken
 In hallowed memory
 Of Christ, Thy well-beloved,
 The darling of Thy heart
 At Calvary we see Him
 Pierced through with judgment's dart.
[V2]
 We trace the way appointed
 That led to Calvary's hill,
 From birth to death obedient
 To Thy most holy will. 
 Thyself in Him reflected,
 O God, what grace and kindness 
 In all His actions shine!
[V3]
 Deep shadows crossed His pathway, 
 Yet deeper still to be;
 We hear His cry of sorrow
 In dark Gethsemane.
 For He alone must suffer,
 Alone the cup must drain
 Of wrath and Thy forsaking,
 Our pardon to obtain.
[V4]
 The Lamb of Thy providing
 Was on the altar laid;
 Our sins were laid upon Him,
 And thus our debt was paid.
 'Twas love divine that bound Him
 In death upon the tree,
 And, joined with sovereign mercy, 
 Has set the captives free.
[V5]
 Freed by such love, we ponder
 The fulness of His grace,
 That brings us in with gladness
 Within the holy place.
 O God, our hearts united
 Would praise Thee for Thy Son, 
 For all in wondrous kindness
 That Thou, through Him, hast done.
