<title>329 IT IS WELL</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 329 IT IS WELL
 WHEN peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
 When sorrows, like sea-billows, roll,
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, 
 "It is well, it is well with my soul."
 It is well, it is well with my soul.
[V2]
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
 Let this blest assurance control—
 That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
 And His blood hath been shed for my soul.
[V3]
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought! 
 My sin, not in part, but the whole
 Was nailed to His cross, and I bear it no more; 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
[V4]
 For me be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live! 
 If Jordan above me shall roll
 No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
 Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
[V5]
 But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait; 
 The sky, not the grave, is our goal.
 Oh voice of archangel! oh shout of the Lord! 
 Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!
