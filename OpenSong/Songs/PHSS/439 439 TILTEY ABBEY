 439 TILTEY ABBEY
 GIVE me the wings of faith to rise
 Within the veil, and see
 The saints above, how great their joys,
 How bright their glories be.
[V2]
 Once they were mourners here below,
 And wet their couch with tears; 
 They wrestled hard, as we do now,
 With sins and doubts and fears.
[V3]
 I ask them whence their victory came; 
 They, with united breath,
 Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
 Their triumph to His death.
[V4]
 They marked the footsteps that He trod,
 His zeal inspired their breast;
 Like Him they walked the way of God.
 And gained the promised rest.
[V5]
 Our glorious Leader claims our praise
 For His own pattern given;
 While the long cloud of witnesses 
 Show the same path to heaven.
