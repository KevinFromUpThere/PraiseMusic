<lyrics>[V1]
 FATHER, I know that all my life
 Is portioned out for me;
 The changes that are sure to come
 I do not fear to see.
 I ask Thee for a present mind,
 Intent on pleasing Thee.
[V2]
 I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
 Through constant watching wise, 
 To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
 And wipe the weeping eyes; 
 A heart at leisure from itself,
 To soothe and sympathise.
[V3]
 I would not have the restless will
 That hurries to and fro,
 That seeks for some great thing to do,
 Or secret thing to know;
 I would be treated as a child, 
 And guided where to go.
[V4]
 Wherever in the world I am,
 In whatsoe'er estate,
 I have a fellowship with hearts
 To keep and cultivate; 
 A work of lowly love to do
 For Him on whom I wait. 
[V5]
 I ask Thee for the daily strength
 To none that ask denied,
 A mind to blend with outward life
 While keeping at Thy side; 
 Content to fill a little space,
 If Christ be glorified.
[V6]
 And if some things I do not ask
 Amongst my blessings be,
 I'd have my spirit filled the more
 With grateful love to Thee;
 More careful not to serve Thee much,
 But please Thee perfectly.
[V7]
 The thorns besetting every path
 Call for a patient care; 
 There is a cross in every lot
 And earnest need for prayer;
 But lowly hearts that lean on Thee 
 Are happy anywhere.
[V8]
 In service which Thy will appoints
 There are no bonds for me;
 My inmost heart would know the truth
 That sets Thy children free 
 "A life of self-renouncing love
 Is one of liberty."
