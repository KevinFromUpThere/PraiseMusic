  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE laud the everlasting Word, 
 The Father's only Son,
 God manifestly seen and heard,
 And heaven's beloved One.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow,
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V2]
 In Him, most perfectly expressed,
 The Father's glories shine;
 Of the full Deity possessed,
 Eternally divine.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow,
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V3]
 True image of the Infinite
 Whose essence is concealed; 
 Brightness of uncreated light,
 The heart of God revealed.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow,
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V4]
 But the high mysteries of His name 
 An angel's grasp transcend;
 The Father only (glorious claim)
 The Son can comprehend.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow,
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V5]
 Yet loving Him, on whom God's love 
 Ineffable doth rest,
 His members allï¿½below, above
 As one with Him are blest.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V6]
 Of the vast universe of bliss
 The centre He and sun;
 Th' eternal theme of praise is this-
 God's well-beloved One.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow,
 That every knee therein should bow.
