<lyrics>[V1]
 COME, let us sing the matchless worth, And sweetly sound the praises forth, Which in the Saviour shine;
 To God our praise of Christ we'll bring, The song with which the heavens ring We'll join through grace divine.
[V2]
 How rich that precious blood once spilt, Our rescue from the dreadful guilt
 Of sin against our God!
 How perfect is the righteousness,
 In which unspotted, beauteous dress
 His saints have always stood!
[V3]
 Great are the offices He bears, And bright His character appears Exalted on the throne.
 In songs of sweet, untiring praise We would to everlasting days Make all His glories known.
[V4]
 And soon the happy day shall come When we shall reach our destined home, And see Him face to face;
 Then with our Saviour, Master, Friend, The glad eternity we'll spend,
 And celebrate God's grace.
