<lyrics>[V1]
 FROM far we see the glorious day When He who bore our sins away Will all His majesty display.
[V2]
 A Man of Sorrows once He was;
 No friend was found to plead His cause, For all preferred the world's applause.
[V3]
 He groaned beneath sin's awful load, For in the sinner's place He stood, And died to bring us nigh to God.
[V4]
 But now He reigns with glory crowned, While angel hosts the throne surround, And still His lofty praises sound.
[V5]
 And there is yet a day to come When He who suffered in our room Will take His waiting people home.
