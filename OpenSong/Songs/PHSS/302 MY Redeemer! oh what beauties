<title>302 CALCUTTA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 MY Redeemer! oh what beauties 
 In that lovely name appear! 
 None but Jesus in His glories
 Shall the honoured title wear. 
 My Redeemer,
 Thou hast my salvation wrought.
[V2]
 Sunk in ruin, sin and misery.
 Bound by Satan's captive chain; 
 Guided by his artful treachery,
 Hurrying on to endless pain;
 My Redeemer
 Plucked me as a brand from hell.
[V3]
 Mine for time and mine for ever,
 Mine by oath and mine by blood, 
 Mine, nor time the bond shall sever,
 Mine as the unchanging God.
 My Redeemer!
 Oh, how sweet to call Him mine!
[V4]
 When in heaven I see Thy glory,
 When before Thy throne I bow, 
 Perfectly I shall be like Thee,
 Fully Thy redemption know.
 My Redeemer
 Then shall hear me shout His praise.
