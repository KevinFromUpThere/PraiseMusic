<lyrics>[V1]
 As pants the hart for cooling streams
 When heated in the chase,
 So longs my soul, O God, for Thee
 And Thy refreshing grace.
[V2]
 For Thee, my God, the living God,
 My thirsty soul doth pine;
 Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
 Thou Majesty divine?
[V3]
 Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
 Hope still, and thou shalt sing 
 The praise of Him who is thy God,
 Thy health's eternal spring.
[V4]
 Oh, send Thy light and send Thy truth, 
 And let them guide me still
 To Zion's mount where Thou dost dwell, 
 Yea, to Thy holy hill.
[V5]
 Unto the altar of my God,
 To God my joy supreme,
 I would draw nigh through precious blood, 
 Where I may worship Him.
