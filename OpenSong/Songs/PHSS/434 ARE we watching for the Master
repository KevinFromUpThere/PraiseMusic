<lyrics>[V1]
 ARE we watching for the Master
 For His coming draweth near; 
 Are we ready for the moment
 When He shall for us appear?
[V2]
 Are we watching for the Master?
 If He should return today,
 Would He come and find us sleeping 
 As the moments pass away?
[V3]
 Are we waiting for the Master?
 Does our light so brightly burn 
 That it shows to all around us
 We await our Lord's return?
[V4]
 Are we waiting for the Master,
 Occupying till He come,
 Seeking in some little measure,
 If so be we may win some?
[V5]
 Are we watching, waiting, praying,
 Listening daily to His voice,
 And obeying His commandments?
 Do we make His heart rejoice?
[V6]
 Are we praying that the Master,
 When He comes to claim His own, 
 May some precious fruit then gather
 From the seed that we have sown?
[V7]
 Soon the watching will be over,
 And the waiting time be past, 
 Earthly praying will be ended;
 We shall meet our Lord at last.
[V8]
 And when in His holy presence
 We again our works shall meet, 
 Will they stand the fiery testing
 At the coming judgment seat?
