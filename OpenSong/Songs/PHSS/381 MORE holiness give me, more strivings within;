<lyrics>[V1]
 MORE holiness give me, more strivings within;
 More patience in suffering, more sorrow for sin; 
 More faith in my Saviour, more sense of His care;
 More joy in His service, more purpose in prayer.
[V2]
 More gratitude give me, more trust in the Lord; 
 More zeal for His glory, more hope in His word; 
 More tears for His sorrows, more pain at His grief; 
 More meekness in trial, more praise for relief.
[V3]
 More purity give me, more strength to o'ercome;
 More freedom from earthstains, more longings for home.
 More fit for the kingdom, more used would I be, 
 More blessed and holy; more, Saviour, like Thee.
