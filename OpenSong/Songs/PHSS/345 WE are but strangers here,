<title>345 FATHERLAND</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WE are but strangers here, 
 Heaven is our home. 
 Earth is a desert drear,
 Heaven is our home. 
 Danger and sorrow stand 
 Round us on every hand; 
 Heaven is our fatherland,
 Heaven is our home.
[V2]
 What though the tempests rage? 
 Heaven is our home. 
 Short is our pilgrimage,
 Heaven is our home. 
 And time's wild wintry blast 
 Soon will be overpast;
 We shall reach home at last, 
 Heaven is our home.
[V3]
 There at the Saviour's side, 
 Heaven is our home. 
 We shall be glorified,
 Heaven is our home. 
 There with the good and blest, 
 Those we loved most and best, 
 We shall for ever rest,
 Heaven is our home.
[V4]
 Therefore we murmur not,
 Heaven is our home, 
 Whate'er our earthly lot,
 Heaven is our home. 
 For we shall surely stand
 There at the Lord's right hand; 
 Heaven is our fatherland, 
 Heaven is our home.
