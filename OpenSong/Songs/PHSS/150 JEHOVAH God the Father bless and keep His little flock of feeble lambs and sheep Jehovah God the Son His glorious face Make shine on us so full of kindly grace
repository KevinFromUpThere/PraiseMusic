<title>150 PAX DEL</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 JEHOVAH God the Father, bless and keep His little flock of feeble lambs and sheep; Jehovah God the Son, His glorious face Make shine on us, so full of kindly grace;
[V2]
 Jehovah God the Paraclete, uplift
 His countenance, and grant us peace, His gift.
 Eternal triune God, with love inflame
 Our souls, to praise Thy great Jehovah name. Amen, amen.
