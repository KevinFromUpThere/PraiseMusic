<lyrics>[V1]
 OUR God, we call upon our souls 
 And all within us that subsists,
 To bless and praise Thy holy name, 
 Nor to forget Thy benefits.
[V2]
 All our iniquities and sins,
 In mercy great Thou hast forgiven, 
 And healest, too, diseases all
 Of our frail frame by boons from heaven.
[V3]
 Our lives are now redeemed by Thee 
 From all destruction, and we're crowned 
 With loving-kindness full and free,
 And tender mercies which abound.
[V4]
 Thou also satisfiest well
 Our hungry mouths with all good things
 So that our youth becomes renewed
 Like eagles as they mount on wings.
[V5]
 And though we're likened unto grass
 Whose flower by wind doth pass away,
 Thy loving-kindness endeth not
 For fearing ones who heed Thy way.
[V6]
 O gracious God, Thy throne's on high, 
 Thy kingdom ruleth over all.
 We join the great angelic hosts
 To bless Thee and before Thee fall.
