  <title>340 SAVIOUR, LEAD US</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 SAVIOUR, through the desert lead us, 
 Without Thee we cannot go;
 Thou from cruel chains hast freed us,
 Thou hast laid the tyrant low;
 Let Thy presence
 Cheer us all the desert through.
[V2]
 With a price Thy love has bought us,
 Saviour, what a love is Thine!
 Hitherto Thy power has brought us, 
 Power and love in Thee combine.
 Lord of glory.
 Ever on Thy people shine.
[V3]
 Through the desert, waste and cheerless,
 Though our destined journey lie, 
 Rendered by Thy presence fearless,
 We may every foe defy.
 Nought shall move us,
 While we see Thee, Saviour, nigh.
[V4]
 When we halt, no track discovering, 
 Fearful lest we go astray,
 O'er our path Thy pillar hovering, 
 Fire by night and cloud by day, 
 Shall direct us;
 Thus we shall not miss our way.
[V5]
 When we hunger Thou wilt feed us,
 Manna shall our camp surround; 
 Faint and thirsty Thou wilt heed us,
 Streams shall from the rock abound.
 Happy people!
 What a Saviour we have found!
