<title>391 PAULINA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WE'RE marching to Canaan with banner and song, 
 We're soldiers enlisted to fight 'gainst the wrong; 
 But lest in the conflict our strength should divide, 
 We ask, "Who among us is on the Lord's side?"
 Oh, who is there among us, the true and the tried, 
 Who'll stand by his colours; who's on the Lord's side?
[V2]
 The sword may be burnished, the armour be bright 
 (E'en Satan appears as an angel of light),
 Yet darkly the bosom may treachery hide,
 While lips are professing, "I'm on the Lord's side."
[V3]
 Oh, is one among us who cleaves not to God, 
 Whose heart follows not in the path to be trod? 
 Let him learn, ere the darkness his footsteps betide, 
 That light, life and peace are upon the Lord's side.
[V4]
 Oh, heed not the sorrow, the pain or the wrong,
 For soon shall our sighing be changed into song; 
 So, bearing the cross of our covenant Guide,
 We'll shout, as we triumph, "I'm on the Lord's side."
