<lyrics>[V1]
 BEHOLD a spotless Victim dies,
 Our surety on the cross;
 The Lamb of God the sacrifice,
 He gave Himself for us.
[V2]
 Whatever curse was ours He bore,
 The wormwood and the gall;
 There in that lone mysterious hour
 Our cup He drained it all.
[V3]
 The Lord Himself and none beside Its bitterness could know,
 Nor other tell the joy's full tide That from that cup shall flow.
[V4]
 The joy is His, yet wondrous grace, That joy to us is given;
 Our joy to His sorerief we trace, His death brings life and heaven.
[V5]
 And, while the ages roll along,
 This shall our glory be,
 And this the new and endless song His love to us, to me.
