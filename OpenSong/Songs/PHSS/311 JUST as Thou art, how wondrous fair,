<title>311 WARRINGTON</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 JUST as Thou art, how wondrous fair, 
 Lord Jesus, all Thy members are!
 A life divine to them is given, 
 A long inheritance in heaven.
[V2]
 Just as I was I came to Thee, 
 An heir of wrath and misery; 
 Just as Thou art before the throne,
 I stand in righteousness Thine own.
[V3]
 Just as Thou art, how wondrous free, 
 Loosed by Thy sorrows on the tree! 
 Lord, all the curse, the wrath were Thine, 
 To give Thy saints this life divine.
[V4]
 Just as Thou art, nor doubt nor fear 
 Can with Thy spotlessness appear. 
 Oh timeless love! as Thee I'm seen, 
 "The righteouness of God in Him."
[V5]
 Just as Thou art, Thou Lamb divine, 
 Life, light, and holiness are Thine. 
 Thyself their endless source I see, 
 And they, the life of God in me.
[V6]
 Just as Thou art, oh blissful ray, 
 That turned my darkness into day, 
 That woke me from my death of sin 
 To know my perfectness in Him!
[V7]
 Oh teach me, Lord, this grace to own, 
 That self and sin no more are known, 
 That love, Thy love, in wondrous right, 
 Hath placed me in its spotless light.
[V8]
 Soon, soon mid joys on joys untold, 
 Thou wilt this grace and love unfold, 
 Till worlds on worlds adoring see 
 The part Thy members have in Thee.
