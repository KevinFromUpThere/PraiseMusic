 341 LUX EOI
 RISE, my soul, thy God directs thee,
 Stranger hands no more impede;
 Pass thou on, His hand protects thee,
 Strength that has the captive freed. 
 Is the wilderness before thee,
 Desert lands where drought abounds?
 Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,
 Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.
[V2]
 Light divine surrounds thy going, 
 God Himself shall mark thy way; 
 Secret blessings richly flowing
 Lead to everlasting day.
 God, thine everlasting portion,
 Feeds thee with the mighty's meat; 
 Price of Egypt's hard extortion, 
 Egypt's food, no more to eat.
[V3]
 Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
 God in secret thee shall keep;
 There unfold His hidden treasures,
 There, His love's exhaustless deep. 
 In the desert God will teach thee
 What the God that thou hast found; 
 All His grace shall there abound.
[V4]
 On to Canaan's rest still wending,
 E'en thy wants and woes shall bring 
 Suited grace from high descending;
 Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring. 
 Though thy way be long and dreary,
 Eagle strength He'll still renew; 
 Garments fresh and foot unweary
 Tell how God has brought thee through.
[V5]
 When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
 Love divine thy foot shall bring,
 There with shouts of triumph swelling
 Zion's songs in rest to sing,
 There no stranger-God shall meet thee
 (Stranger thou in courts above); 
 He who to His rest shall greet thee
 Greets thee with a well-known love.
