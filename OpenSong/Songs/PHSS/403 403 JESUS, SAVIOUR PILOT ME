  <lyrics>[V1]
 LIFE and light and joy are found
 In the presence of the Lord;
 Life, with richest blessings crowned, 
 Light, from many fountains poured; 
 Life and light and holy joy
 None can darken or destroy.
[V2]
 Bring to Him life's brightest hours,
 He will make them still more bright; 
 Give to Him your noblest powers,
 He will hallow all your might; 
 Come to Him with eager quest, 
 You shall hear His high behest.
[V3]
 All your questions large and deep,
 All the open thoughts of youth,
 Bring to Him, and you shall reap
 All the harvest of His truth; 
 You shall find in that great store 
 Largest love and wisest lore.
[V4]
 Then, when come life's wider sphere 
 And its busier enterprise,
 You shall find Him ever near,
 Looking with approving eyes 
 On all honest work and true
 That His servant's hands can do.
[V5]
 And if care should dim your eye,
 And life's shadows come apace, 
 You shall find Him ever nigh
 In His all-abounding grace, 
 Changing sorrow's darkest night
 Into morning clear and bright.
