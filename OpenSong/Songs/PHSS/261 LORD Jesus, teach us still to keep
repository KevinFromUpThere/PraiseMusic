<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus, teach us still to keep
 Our eyes on Thee, the living way;
 That we, once lost and wandering sheep, 
 From Thee, our Lord, no more may stray; 
 But wheresoe'er Thou leadest, we
 May follow on most cheerfully.
[V2]
 Oh, that we never might forget
 What Thou hast suffered for our sake, 
 To save our souls, and make us meet 
 In all Thy glory to partake;
 But keeping this in sight press on 
 To glory and a victor's crown!
[V3]
 But, gracious Lord, when we reflect 
 How oft we've turned our eye from Thee;
 Have treated Thee with sad neglect
 And listened to the enemy;
 And yet to find Thee still the same 
 'Tis this that humbles us with shame.
[V4]
 Astonished at Thy feet we fall;
 Thy love exceeds our highest thought; 
 Henceforth be Thou our all in all,  
 Thou, who our souls with blood hast bought
 May we henceforth more faithful prove, 
 And ne'er forget Thy ceaseless love.
