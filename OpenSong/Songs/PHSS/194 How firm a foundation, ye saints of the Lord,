<lyrics>[V1]
 How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, 
 Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
 What more can He say, than to you He hath said, 
 You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?
[V2]
 In poverty's vale or abounding in wealth,
 At home or abroad, on the land or the sea,
 As th' day may demand shall thy strength ever be.
[V3]
 I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
 Will strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, 
 Upheld by My righteous omnipotent hand.
[V4]
 The floods of distress shall not thee overflow; 
 For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
 And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.
[V5]
 My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
 The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design 
 Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.
[V6]
  My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
 And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn, 
 Like lambs they shall still on My bosom be borne.
[V7]
 I will not, I cannot desert to its foes;
 That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,
  I'll never, no never, no never forsake."
