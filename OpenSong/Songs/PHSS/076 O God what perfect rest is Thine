  <lyrics>[V1]
 O God, what perfect rest is Thine!
 Thy rest is in Thy Son;
 'Tis all unspeakable, divine,
 Thy rest and ours are one. 
 Inside the circle of Thy love 
 Joined to His life are we above;
 How sweet with Thee, O God, to share 
 The joy which is Thy portion there!
[V2]
 Thou findest in that spotless One,
 Where all perfections dwell,
 All that Thy heart could wish for us,
 All that Thou e'er couldst tell; 
 Thou findest ransomed, righteous, fair, 
 Where all Thy joys transcendent are, 
 In Him a people for Thy praise,
 Thy glory through eternal days.
