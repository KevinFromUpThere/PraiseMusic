<lyrics>[V1]
 O God, what perfect rest is Thine!
 Thy rest is in Thy Son;
 'Tis all unspeakable, divine,
 Thy rest and ours are one. Inside the circle of Thy love Joined to His life are we above;
 How sweet with Thee, O God, to share The joy which is Thy portion there!
[V2]
 Thou findest in that spotless One,
 Where all perfections dwell,
 All that Thy heart could wish for us,
 All that Thou e'er couldst tell; Thou findest ransomed, righteous, fair, Where all Thy joys transcendent are, In Him a people for Thy praise,
 Thy glory through eternal days.
