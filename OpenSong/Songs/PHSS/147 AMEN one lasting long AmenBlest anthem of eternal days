<lyrics>[V1]
 AMEN, one lasting, long Amenï¿½Blest anthem of eternal days;
 The fulness of the rapturous song
 To Christ the Saviour's endless praise.
[V2]
 Amen, one lasting, long Amenï¿½Heaven's blissful cadence, deep and loud, While every heart before the throne
 In holy, solemn awe is bowed.
[V3]
 Amen, Amen, it rolls along, Re-echoing from the throne again; Be ours to mingle with the throng In that eternal, loud Amen.
 148f RICHMOND
 LORD of the worlds above, How pleasant and how fair The dwellings of Thy love, The heavenly mansions are!
 To Thine abode
 Our hearts aspire With warm desire To see our God.
[V2]
 There is Thy throne of grace, And there the sprinkled blood; There lives before Thy face Our great High Priest, O God;
 His name our plea,
 We now draw near
 In holy fear
 To worship Thee.
