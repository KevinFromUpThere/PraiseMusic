 303 MY REDEEMER
 I WILL sing of my Redeemer
 And His wondrous love to me; 
 On the cruel cross He suffered,
 From the curse to set me free.
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer!
 With His blood He purchased me; 
 On the cross He sealed my pardon,
 Paid the debt and made me free.
[V2]
 I will tell the wondrous story,
 How my lost estate to save,
 In His boundless love and mercy
 He the ransom freely gave.
[V3]
 I will praise my great Redeemer, 
 His triumphant power I'll tell; 
 How the victory He giveth
 Over sin and death and hell. 
[V4]
 I will sing of my Redeemer
 And His heavenly love to me;
 He from death to life hath brought me, 
 Son of God with Him to be.
