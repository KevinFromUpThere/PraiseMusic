<lyrics>[V1]
 O CHRIST, Thou heavenly Lamb, 
 Joy of the Father's heart,
 Now let Thy love my soul inflame: 
 Fresh power to me impart.
[V2]
 Power to know the loss 
 Suffered, O Lord, by Thee;
 Power to glory in the cross 
 Thou didst endure for me.
[V3]
 Power to feel Thy love, 
 And all its depths to know;
 Power to fix the heart above, 
 And die to all below.
[V4]
 Power to keep the eye
 For ever fixed on Thee; 
 Power to lift the warning cry 
 To souls from wrath to flee.
[V5]
 Power lost souls to win 
 From Satan's mighty hold; 
 Power the wanderers to bring 
 Back to the heavenly fold.
[V6]
 Power to watch, and pray, 
 "Lord Jesus, quickly come;" 
 Power to hail the happy day, 
 Destined to bear me home.
[V7]
 Lord Jesus, then to me
 Power divine impart
 To swell redemption's song to Thee,
  For worthy, Lord, Thou art.
