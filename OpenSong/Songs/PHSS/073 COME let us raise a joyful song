  <lyrics>[V1]
 COME, let us raise a joyful song
 Of Christ upon the throne,
 And join with heaven's angelic throng 
 To make His glories known.
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.
[V2]
 "Worthy the One who died," they cry, 
 "To be exalted thus:"
 "Worthy is He," our lips reply,
 "For He was slain for us."
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.
[V3]
 The highest honours to receive
 The Lord all worthy is,
 And blessings, more than we can give, 
 Shall be for ever His.
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.
[V4]
 Let all that dwell above the sky,
 And air, and earth, and seas,
 Conspire to raise His glories high,
 And speak His endless praise.
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.
[V5]
 Creation soon shall join in one
 To bless the sacred name
 Of Him who sits upon the throne, 
 And to exalt the Lamb.
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen.
