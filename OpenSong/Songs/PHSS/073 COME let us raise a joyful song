<lyrics>[V1]
 COME, let us raise a joyful song
 Of Christ upon the throne,
 And join with heaven's angelic throng To make His glories known.
 Hallelujah for the Lamb
 That was slain on Mount Calvary. Hallelujah! Amen.
[V2]
 "Worthy the One who died," they cry, "To be exalted thus:"
 "Worthy is He," our lips reply,
 "For He was slain for us."
[V3]
 The highest honours to receive
 The Lord all worthy is,
 And blessings, more than we can give, Shall be for ever His.
[V4]
 Let all that dwell above the sky,
 And air, and earth, and seas,
 Conspire to raise His glories high,
 And speak His endless praise.
[V5]
 Creation soon shall join in one
 To bless the sacred name
 Of Him who sits upon the throne, And to exalt the Lamb.
