 428 CHRIST RETURNETH 
 IT may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
 When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,
 Christ Jesus will come in the fulness of glory, 
 To take from the world His own.
 O Lord Jesus, how long ere we shout the glad song? 
 "Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
[V2]
 It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,
 It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight 
 Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
 When Christ shall return for His own.
[V3]
 Oh joy, oh delight, should we go without dying! 
 No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying, 
 Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
 When Christ shall return for His own!
