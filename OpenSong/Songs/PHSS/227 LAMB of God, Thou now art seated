<lyrics>[V1]
 LAMB of God, Thou now art seated
 High upon Thy Father's throne, 
 All Thy gracious work completed,
 All Thy mighty victory won.
 Every knee in heaven is bending
 To the Lamb for sinners slain; 
 Every voice and harp is swelling,
 "Worthy is the Lamb to reign."
[V2]
 Lord, in all Thy power and glory,
 Still Thy thoughts and eyes are here, 
 Watching o'er Thy ransomed people,
 To Thy gracious heart so dear;
 Thou for us art interceding
 (Everlasting is Thy love),
 And a blessed rest preparing
 In our Father's house above. 
[V3]
 Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory
 Wilt to this sad earth return;
 All Thy foes shall quake before Thee, 
 All that now despise Thee, mourn.
 Then Thy saints appearing with Thee,
 With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;
 Thine the praise and Thine the glory, 
 Lamb of God for sinners slain! Amen.
