  <title>116 Great Jehovah Living One</title>
  <lyrics>
[V1]
 Great Jehovah, Living One,
 On Thy high eternal throne,
 Thine almighty majesty,
 Calls for homage due to Thee.
[V2]
 Dwelling in the light intense, 
 Holy in omnipotence,
 All Thy ways are righteousness, 
 We with reverence would confess.
[V3]
 Thine unequalled wisdom shines 
 Gloriously in Thy designs;
 All things working to fulfil 
 Counsels of Thy sovereign will.
[V4]
 God of providence! Thy care, 
 Shown by gifts Thy creatures share, 
 Bids Thy vast creation raise
 One harmonious song of praise.
[V5]
 Father of our blessed Lord,
 Ever be Thy name adored
 For that One of matchless worth, 
 Who so fully told Thee forth.
[V6]
 In the work He wrought we see
 Power and wisdom, wondrously 
 Joined with love and righteousness,
 Us eternally to bless.
[V7]
 For the life He lived below,
 For the cross with all its woe,
 For His glorious victory,
 We would praise and worship Thee. 
[V8]
 Great Jehovah throned on high,
 By Thy Blessed Son brought nigh
 Cleansed and clothed as priests we bring
 In His name thank-offering.</lyrics>
