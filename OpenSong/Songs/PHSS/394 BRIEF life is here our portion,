<lyrics>[V1]
 BRIEF life is here our portion,
 Brief sorrow, short-lived care; 
 The life that knows no ending,
 The tearless life is there.
[V2]
 Oh, happy retribution—
 Short toil, eternal rest;
 For cleansed and ransomed sinners 
 A mansion with the blest.
[V3]
 For now we fight the battle,
 But then shall wear the crown 
 Of full and everlasting
 And passionless renown.
[V4]
 And now we watch and struggle, 
 And now we live in hope; 
 And Zion in her anguish
 With Babylon must cope. 
[V5]
 But He whom now we trust in,
 Shall then be seen and known; 
 And they that know and see Him
 Shall have Him for their own.
[V6]
 The morning shall awaken,
 The shadows pass away,
 And each true-hearted servant
 Shall shine as doth the day.
[V7]
 There God our blessed portion, 
 In fulness of His grace,
 We shall behold for ever
 And worship face to face.
[V8]
 Then quickly come, Lord Jesus, 
 And take Thy people home; 
 We long for Thy returning,
 Lord Jesus, quickly come! Amen.
[V15]
 For Young Disciples
