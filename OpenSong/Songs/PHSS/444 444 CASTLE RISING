 444 CASTLE RISING
 THE roseate hues of early dawn,
 The brightness of the day,
 The crimson of the sunset sky,
 How fast they fade away!
 Oh, for the pearly gates of heaven, 
 Oh, for the golden floor,
 Oh, for the Sun of righteousness, 
 That setteth nevermore!
[V2]
 The highest hopes we cherish here,
 How fast they tire and faint!
 How many a spot defiles the robe
 That wraps an earthly saint! 
 Oh, for a heart that never sins,
 For robes unsullied white;
 Oh, for a voice to praise our Lord,
 Nor weary day nor night!
[V3]
 Here faith is ours, and heavenly hope, 
 And grace to lead us higher;
 But there are perfectness and peace 
 Beyond our best desire.
 Oh, by Thy love and anguish, Lord, 
 And by Thy life laid down,
 Grant that we fail not Thee to please, 
 Nor fail to win the crown!
