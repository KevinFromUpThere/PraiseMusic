<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD, Thou source of life eternal,
 Thou the author of our breath, 
 Victor o'er the hosts infernal
 By defeat and shame and death, 
 Thou through deepest tribulation, 
 Deigned to pass for our salvation;
 Thousand, thousand praises be,
 Lord of glory, unto Thee!
[V2]
 Thou, O Son of God, wert bearing
 Cruel mockings, hatred, scorn; 
 Thou, the King of glory, wearing
 For our sake the crown of thorn! 
 Dying, Thou didst us deliver
 From the chains of sin for ever;
 Thousand, thousand praises be,
 Blessed Saviour, unto Thee!
[V3]
 All the shame men heaped upon Thee
  Thou didst patiently endure;
 Not the pains of death too bitter 
 Our redemption to procure. 
 Wondrous Thy humiliation,
 To accomplish our salvation; 
 Thousand, thousand praises be
 Blessed Saviour, unto Thee!
[V4]
 Heartfelt praise and adoration, 
 Saviour, thus to Thee we give, 
 For Thy deep humiliation,
 For Thy death by which we live.
 All the grief Thou hast endured,
 All the bliss Thou hast secured; 
 Evermore the theme shall be 
 Of thanksgiving, Lord, to Thee.
