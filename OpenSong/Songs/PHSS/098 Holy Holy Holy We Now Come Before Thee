  <title>098 Holy Holy Holy We Now Come Before Thee</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 HOLY, holy, holy, we now come before Thee, 
 Gathered in that holy name so very dear to Thee.
 O Lord God, we own Thee, humbly we adore Thee, 
 For Thy grace and power and truth and love we see.
[V2]
 Thou Thy Son hast given, see His body riven,
 Pierced with cruel thorn and spear upon Golgotha's tree. 
 For our sins He suffered, and His body offered,
 And His blood outpoured a sacrifice to Thee.
[V3]
 Now through Jesus' merit, gathered by the Spirit,
 Here within the holy place, through Him we boldly come; 
 Hearts and voices blending, praise to Thee ascending, 
 Through our great High Priest we worship Thee alone.
[V4]
 Holy, holy, holy, humbly we adore Thee,
 Honour, blessing, power and might we would ascribe to Thee ; 
 Courts of heaven ringing with the praise were bringing,
 For the One who lives our living Lord to be.
