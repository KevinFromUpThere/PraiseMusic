  <title>099 Oh Lord They Courts We Humbly Tread</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord, Thy courts we humbly tread, 
 By Thy blest Spirit hither led;
 We bring our sacrifice of praise, 
 Adoring Thee in grateful lays.
[V2]
 Chosen in Christ, oh, wondrous grace; 
 Assured by Him a heavenly place!
 Ere worlds at Thy command were made, 
 Salvation's wondrous plan was laid.
[V3]
 How could Thy heart such love conceive 
 To slay Thy Son and us receive?
 To charge with guilt the Holy One, 
 Forsake Thy well-beloved Son?
[V4]
 The stream of love divine alone
 Through Christ could pardon and atone; 
 Eternal ages it had flowed,
 And at the cross its fulness showed.
[V5]
 Accepted through His death are we 
 To be a priesthood, serving Thee.
 What joy is ours, through saving grace, 
 To worship in the holy place!
[V6]
 Thus boldly we now enter in,
 Cleansed by Christ's blood from every sin; 
 It speaks for us before Thy throne, 
 Proclaims redemption's work is done.
[V7]
 Great God, Thy love all love excels; 
 It humbles us, yet praise compels! 
 Eternally our song shall be
 Of Him who said, "Remember Me."</lyrics>
