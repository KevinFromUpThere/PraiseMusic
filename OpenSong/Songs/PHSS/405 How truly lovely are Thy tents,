<lyrics>[V1]
 How truly lovely are Thy tents, 
 O Lord of hosts, to me!
 My longing soul faints for Thy courts, 
 My heart cries out to Thee.
 The sparrow and the swallow there
 Find for their young a nest;
 Thine altars, O my King and God,
 Provide for them a rest.
[V2]
 Who in Thy house abide are blest, 
 They will be praising still;
 And blest is he who, trusting, loves 
 The ways to Zion's hill.
 Joy-springs and blessings mark their path 
 Along this vale of tears;
 With strength renewed before their God
  In Zion each appears.
[V3]
 Thine ear to my petitions, Lord,
 Thou God of Jacob, yield.
 Look now on Thine Anointed's face; 
 Behold, O God, our shield.
 A day that's spent within Thy courts 
 A thousand ne'er excel;
 I'd rather keep a door therein,
 Than with the wicked dwell.
[V4]
 Himself to be a sun and shield,
 The Lord, our God, doth show. 
 Unstinted grace and glory, too,
 He surely will bestow.
 No good from them will He withhold,
 Who walk now perfectly;
 Yea, blessed is the man who trusts,
 O Lord of hosts, in Thee.
