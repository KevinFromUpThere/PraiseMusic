<title>45 ST. MICHAEL'S</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 His be the Victor's name
 Who fought the fight alone; Triumphant saints no honour claim, Their conquest was His own.
[V2]
 By weakness and defeat
 He won the meed and crown; Trod all our foes beneath His feet By being trodden down.
[V3]
 He hell in hell laid low,
 Made sin, He sin o'erthrew,
 Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so, And death by dying slew.
[V4]
 Bless, bless the Conqueror slain, Slain in His victOry,
 Who lived, who died, who lives again
 For thee, His Church, for thee.
