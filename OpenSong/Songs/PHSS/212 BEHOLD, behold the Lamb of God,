<lyrics>[V1]
 BEHOLD, behold the Lamb of God,
 On the cross.
 For us He shed His precious blood,
 On the cross.
 Oh, hear His awful, anguished cry, 
 "Eli, lama sabachthani;"
 Draw near and see the Saviour die
 On the cross. 
[V2]
 Behold His arms extended wide,
 On the cross.
 Behold His bleeding hands and side,
 On the cross.
 The sun withholds its rays of light, 
 The heavens are clothed in shades of
 While Jesus fights the dreadful fight
 On the cross.
[V3]
 By faith we see Him lifted up,
 On the cross.
 He drinks for us the bitter cup,
 On the cross.
 The rocks are rent, the mountains quake, 
 While Jesus doth atonement make,
 While Jesus suffers for our sake
 On the cross.
[V4]
 And now the mighty deed is done,
 On the cross.
 The battle's fought, the victory won,
 On the cross.
 To heaven He turns His holy eyes,
 " 'Tis finished," now the Conqueror cries, 
 Then bows His sacred head and dies
 On the cross.
[V5]
 Whereer I go, I'll tell the story
 Of the cross.
 In nothing else my soul shall glory,
 Save the cross.
 Yes, this my constant theme shall be, 
 Through time and in eternity—
 How Jesus conquered death for me
 On the cross.
