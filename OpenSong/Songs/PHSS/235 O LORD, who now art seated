<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, who now art seated 
 Above the heavens on high, 
 The gracious work completed,
 For which Thou cam'st to die, 
 To Thee our hearts are lifted,
 While pilgrims wandering here, 
 For Thou alone art gifted
 Our every weight to bear.
[V2]
 We know that Thou hast bought us
 And cleansed us by Thy blood;
 We know Thy grace has brought us
 As kings and priests to God:
 We know that soon the morning
 Long looked for hasteth near, 
 When we, at Thy returning,
 In glory shall appear.
[V3]
 O Lord, Thy love's unbounded, 
 So full, so vast, so free!
 Our thoughts are all confounded
 Whene'er we think of Thee.
 For us Thou cam'st from heaven, 
 For us to bleed and die:
 That, purchased and forgiven,
 We might ascend on high.
[V4]
 Oh, let this love constrain us
 To give our hearts to Thee;
 Let nothing henceforth pain us 
 But that which paineth Thee; 
 Our joy, our one endeavour,
 Through suffering, conflict, shame, 
 To serve Thee, gracious Saviour, 
 And magnify Thy name.
