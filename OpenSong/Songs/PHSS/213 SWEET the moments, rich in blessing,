<lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET the moments, rich in blessing,
 Which before the cross we spend,
 Life and health and peace possessing,
 From the sinner's dying Friend. 
 Here we rest, in wonder viewing
 All our sins on Jesus laid,
 And a full redemption flowing
 From the sacrifice He made.
[V2]
 Truly blessed is the station,
 Low before the cross to lie, 
 And behold the great salvation
 To rebellious man brought nigh.
 Here we find the dawn of heaven,
 While upon the cross we gaze, 
 See our trespasses forgiven,
 And our songs of triumph raise.
[V3]
 Oh that near the cross abiding
 We may to the Saviour cleave, 
 Nought from Him our hearts dividing,
 All for Him content to leave.
 May we still, the cross discerning,
 There for peace and comfort go, 
 There new wonders daily learning,
 All the depths of mercy know.
