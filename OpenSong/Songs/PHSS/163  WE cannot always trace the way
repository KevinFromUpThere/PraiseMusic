<lyrics>[V1]
  WE cannot always trace the way
 Where Thou, our gracious Lord, dost move;
 But we can always surely say
 That Thou art love.
[V2]
 When fear its gloomy cloud will fling 
 O'er earth; our souls to heaven above. 
 As to their sanctuary, spring;
 For Thou art love.
[V3]
 When mystery shrouds our darkened path, 
 We'll check our dread, our doubts remove; 
 In this each saint sweet comfort hath 
 That Thou art love.
[V4]
 Yes, Thou art love. A truth like this 
 Can every gloomy thought remove, 
 And turn our tears and woe to bliss;
 Our God is love.
