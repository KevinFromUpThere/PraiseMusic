 353 OLD 120TH
 "I GAVE My life for thee; 
 My precious blood was shed,
 That thou might'st ransomed be, 
 And quickened from the dead.
 I gave My life for thee;
 What hast thou given for Me?
[V2]
 "I spent long years for thee,
  In weariness and woe,
 That an eternity
 Of joy thou mightest know.
 I spent long years for thee; 
 Hast thou spent one for Me?
[V3]
 "My Father's home of light, 
 My rainbow-circled throne,
 I left, for earthly night,
 For wanderings sad and lone.
 I left it all for thee;
 Hast thou left aught for Me?
[V4]
 "I suffered much for thee, 
 More than thy tongue can tell, 
 Of bitterest agony
 To rescue thee from hell.
 I suffered much for thee;
 What canst thou bear for Me?
[V5]
 "And I have brought to thee, 
 Down from My home above, 
 Salvation full and free,
 My pardon and My love. 
 Great gifts I brought to thee;
 What hast thou brought to Me?" 
[V6]
 Oh, let my life be given,
 My years for Thee be spent; 
 World fetters all be riven, 
 And joy with suffering blent. 
 What Thou hast done for me 
 Demands my all for Thee.
