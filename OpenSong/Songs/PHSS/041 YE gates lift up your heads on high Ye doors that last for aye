<lyrics>[V1]
 YE gates, lift up your heads on high; Ye doors that last for aye,
 Be lifted up, that so the King
 Of glory enter may!
 But who of glory is the King?
 The mighty Lord is this,
 E'en that same Lord that great in might And strong in battle is.
[V2]
 Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors, Doors that do last for aye,
 Be lifted up, that so the King
 Of glory enter may!
 But who is He that is the King
 Of glory? Who is this?
 The Lord of hosts, and none but He, The King of glory is.
 Praise Jehovah! Bless Jehovah! Hallelujah! Amen, amen, amen.
