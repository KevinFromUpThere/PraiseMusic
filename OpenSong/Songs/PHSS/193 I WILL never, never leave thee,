<title>193 BENEDICTION</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I WILL never, never leave thee,
 I will never thee forsake;
 I will guard and save and keep thee 
 For My name and mercy's sake. 
 Fear no evil,
 Only all My counsel take.
[V2]
 When the storm is raging round thee,
 Call on Me in humble prayer; 
 I will fold My arms about thee,
 Guard thee with the tenderest care.
 In the trial
 I will make thy pathway clear.
[V3]
 When the sky above is glowing,
 And around thee all is bright, 
 Pleasure like a river flowing,
 All things tending to delight,
 I'll be with thee,
 I will guide thy steps aright.
[V4]
 When thy soul is dark and clouded,
 Filled with doubt and grief and care,
 Through the mist by which 'tis shrouded
 I will make a light appear.
 And the banner
 Of My love I will uprear.
