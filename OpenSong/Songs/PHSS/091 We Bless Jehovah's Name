  <title>091 We Bless Jehovah's Name</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE bless Jehovah's name,
 Our sins are all forgiven;
 To suffer once to earth Christ came, 
 And now He's crowned in heaven.
[V2]
 His body offered up,
 His blood shed once for all,
 This broken loaf and poured-out cup 
 So preciously recall.
[V3]
 We never would forget
 His rich, unbounded love,
 Our theme of joy and wonder here, 
 Our endless song above. Amen.
