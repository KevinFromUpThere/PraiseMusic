<lyrics>[V1]
 CHRIST the Lord will come again, Hallelujah!
 Not to suffer woe or pain, Hallelujah! 
 But in majesty to reign, Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Christ will come into the air, Hallelujah!
 Changed or raised we'll meet Him there, Hallelujah!
 Evermore His image bear, Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Christ will come to Israel's land, Hallelujah!
 He on Olive's mount will stand, Hallelujah! 
 With His overcoming band, Hallelujah!
[V4]
 Christ shall reign the wide world o'er, Hallelujah! 
 Vice shall lift its head no more, Hallelujah!
 Peace shall spread from shore to shore, Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Seated on the great white throne, Hallelujah! 
 Him as Lord, and Lord alone, Hallelujah! 
 All mankind shall fully own, Hallelujah!
[V6]
 We by whom Thou'rt now adored, Hallelujah!
 Cry to Thee with one accord, Hallelujah! 
 Quickly come, Christ Jesus, Lord, Hallelujah!
