<lyrics>[V1]
 HE lives, the great Redeemer lives 
 (What joy the blest assurance gives!) 
 And now before His Father, God, 
 Pleads the full merit of His blood.
[V2]
 Great Advocate, almighty Friend, 
 On Him do all our hopes depend; 
 Our cause can never, never fail, 
 For He doth plead, and must prevail.
[V3]
 In every dark, distressing hour,
 When sin and Satan join their power, 
 Let this blest truth repel each dart—
 That Christ doth bear us on His heart.
