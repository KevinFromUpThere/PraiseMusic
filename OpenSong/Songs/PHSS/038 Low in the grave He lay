  <title>38 LOWRY</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Low in the grave He lay,
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Waiting the coming day, Jesus, my Lord!

 Up from the grave He arose
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
 And He lives for ever with His saints to reign; He arose!
 Hallelujah! Christ arose!
[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus, my Saviour!
 Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus, my Lord!
[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus, my Saviour!
 He tore the bars away!
 Jesus, my Lord!

 39 EASTER HYMN
[V1] 
 CHRIST the Lord is risen to-day, Hallelujah! 
 Sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high, Hallelujah! 
 Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Love's redeeming work is done, Hallelujah! 
 Fought the fight, the battle won, Hallelujah! 
 Lo, our Sun's eclipse is o'er, Hallelujah!
 Lo, He sets in death no more, Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Hallelujah! 
 Christ hath burst the gates of Sheol, Hallelujah! 
 Death in vain forbids Him rise, Hallelujah! 
 Christ hath opened Paradise, Hallelujah!
[V4]
 Lives again the glorious King, Hallelujah! 
 Where, O Death, is now thy sting? Hallelujah! 
 Once He died our souls to save, Hallelujah! 
 Where's thy victory, O Grave? Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Lord of earth and heaven He is, Hallelujah! 
 Everlasting life is this, Hallelujah!
 Him to know, His power to prove, Hallelujah! 
 Him to laud, and Him to love, Hallelujah! Amen.
