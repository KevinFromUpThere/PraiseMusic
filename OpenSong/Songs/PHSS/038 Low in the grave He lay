<title>38 LOWRY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Low in the grave He lay,
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Waiting the coming day, Jesus, my Lord!
 Up from the grave He arose
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
 And He lives for ever with His saints to reign; He arose!
 Hallelujah! Christ arose!
[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus, my Saviour!
 Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus, my Lord!
[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus, my Saviour!
 He tore the bars away!
 Jesus, my Lord!
 39t EASTER HYMN
 CHRIST the Lord is risen to-day, Hallelujah! Sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high, Hallelujah! Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Hallelujah!
[V2]
 Love's redeeming work is done, Hallelujah! Fought the fight, the battle won, Hallelujah! Lo, our Sun's eclipse is o'er, Hallelujah!
 Lo, He sets in death no more, Hallelujah!
[V3]
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Hallelujah! Christ hath burst the gates of Sheol, Hallelujah! Death in vain forbids Him rise, Hallelujah! Christ hath opened Paradise, Hallelujah!
[V4]
 Lives again the glorious King, Hallelujah! Where, O Death, is now thy sting? Hallelujah! Once He died our souls to save, Hallelujah! Where's thy victory, O Grave? Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Lord of earth and heaven He is, Hallelujah! Everlasting life is this, Hallelujah!
 Him to know, His power to prove, Hallelujah! Him to laud, and Him to love, Hallelujah! Amen.
