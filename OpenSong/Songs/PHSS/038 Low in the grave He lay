  <title>38 LOWRY</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Low in the grave He lay,
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Waiting the coming day, 
 Jesus, my Lord!

[C]
 Up from the grave He arose (He arose)
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes; (He arose)
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
 And He lives for ever with His saints to reign; 
 He arose! He arose!
 Hallelujah! Christ arose!

[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed, 
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 Vainly they seal the dead, 
 Jesus, my Lord!

[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey, 
 Jesus, my Saviour!
 He tore the bars away!
 Jesus, my Lord!
