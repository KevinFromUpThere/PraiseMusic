  <title>129 LION OF JUDAH</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 TO HIM who is able
 To keep us His called ones, 
 Preserved in Christ Jesus, 
 The saints of the Father
 To keep us from falling, 
 And faultless to set us 
 Before His bright glory
 With fulness of joy.


[V2]
 To the Lord God, who keepeth
 Midst sin and in weakness, 
 Whose wisdom alone is,
 To God and our Saviour
 Be majesty, glory, 
 Dominion and power,
 Both now and for ever,
 Amen, amen,
