<lyrics>[V1]
 O BLEST Lord Jesus, who but Thou 
 On earth, in heaven above,
 May claim from all our willing hearts, 
 The full response of love?
[V2]
 We love Thy brethren, Lord, 'tis true, 
 Because in them we see
 Sweet traces of Thy blessed self, 
 As here they walk with Thee.
[V3]
 But oh! Thou loving One, 'twas Thine, 
 Thine only, Lord, to part
 With life, and all that love could give,
 To win the wandering heart.
[V4]
 Thus, heirs of endless bliss with Thee, 
 We love Thee and adore.
 And ask Thee, Lord, that we may learn 
 To love Thee more and more.
