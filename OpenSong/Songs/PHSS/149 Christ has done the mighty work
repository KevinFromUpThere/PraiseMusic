  <lyrics>[V1]
 CHRIST has done the mighty work; 
 Nothing left for us to do
 But to enter on His toil,
 Enter on His triumph too.
[V2]
 His the pardon, ours the sin
 Great the sin, the pardon great; 
 His the good, and ours the ill; 
 His the love, and ours the hate.
[V3]
 His the labour, ours the rest; 
 His the death, and ours the life; 
 Ours the fruits of victory,
 His the agony and strife.
[V4]
 He has sown the precious seed, 
 Nothing left for us unsown; 
 Ours it is to reap the field, 
 Make the harvest joy our own.
