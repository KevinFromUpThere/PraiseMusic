<lyrics>[V1]
 A MIND at perfect peace with God, 
 Oh, what a word is this!
 A sinner reconciled through blood, 
 This, this indeed is peace.
[V2]
 By nature and by practice far,
 How very far from God!
 Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him, 
 Through faith in Jesus' blood.
[V3]
 So nigh, so very nigh to God,
  I cannot nearer be;
 For in the person of His Son 
 I am as near as He.
[V4]
 So dear, so very dear to God,
 More dear I cannot be;
 The love wherewith He loves His Son, 
 Such is His love to me.
[V5]
 Why should I ever anxious be,
 Since such a God is mine?
 He watches o'er me night and day,
 And tells me," Mine is thine."
