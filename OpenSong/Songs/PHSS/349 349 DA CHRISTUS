 349 DA CHRISTUS
 FAINT not, Christian, though the road 
 Leading to thy blest abode
 Darksome be and dangerous too; 
 Christ, thy Guide, will bring thee through.
[V2]
 Faint not, Christian, though in rage 
 Satan doth thy soul engage;
 Take thee faith's anointed shield, 
 Bear it to the battlefield.
[V3]
 Faint not, Christian, though the world 
 Has its hostile flag unfurled;
 Hold the cross of Jesus fast, 
 Thou shalt overcome at last.
[V4]
 Faint not, Christian, though within 
 There's a heart so prone to sin; 
 Christ, the Lord, is over all, 
 Trusting Him thou wilt not fall.
[V5]
 Faint not, Christian, though thy God 
 Smite thee with a chastening rod; 
 Smite He must with Father's care 
 That He may His love declare.
[V6]
 Faint not, Christian, Christ is near, 
 Soon in glory He'll appear;
 Thou shalt end thy toil and strife, 
 Death be swallowed up of life.
