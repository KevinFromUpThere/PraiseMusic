<lyrics>[V1]
 281 THINE OWN WAY
 HAVE Thine own way, Lord, 
 Have Thine own way; 
 Thou art the Potter,
 I am the clay.
 Mould me and make me 
 After Thy will,
 While I am waiting,
 Yielded and still.
[V2]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way;
 Search me and try me, 
 Whiter than snow, Lord,
 Wash me just now, 
 As in Thy presence
 Humbly I bow.
[V3]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way;
 Wounded and weary,
 Help me, I pray.
 Power, all power, 
 Surely is Thine;
 Touch me and heal me, 
 Saviour divine.
[V4]
 Have Thine own way, Lord,
 Have Thine own way;
 Hold o'er my being
 Absolute sway.
 Fill with Thy Spirit
 Till all shall see
 Christ only, always,
 Living in me.
