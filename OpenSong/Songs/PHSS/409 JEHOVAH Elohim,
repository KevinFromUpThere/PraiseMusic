<lyrics>[V1]
 JEHOVAH Elohim,
 Thou Father and Thou Son
 And Holy Spirit too
 So perfectly are one.
 Thy purposes and works agree 
 In an eternal unity.
[V2]
 Thou Author of our lives, 
 The counsels of Thy mind 
 Decreed our union,
 And Thou in one didst bind 
 Our lives in Christ inseparable, 
 A Body indivisible.
[V3]
 'Tis precious too, O God, 
 Thine eye should look upon 
 Thy scattered children here 
 United into one.
 Lord, may Thy word for ever be 
 Our guide to perfect unity.
[V4]
 Grant that more perfectly 
 Thy will may be expressed,
 That gathered saints may show 
 Thy way of truth is best.
 So mid this discord men may see 
 Divinely ordered unity.
[V5]
 Light and discernment give
  Those who are unaware 
 Dark error binds their feet 
 In Satan's subtle snare;
 Unfold Thy way of unity,
 Show them the one Community.
[V6]
 All heaven shall soon rejoice
 (Oh, haste the blissful day),
 When Thou shalt call Thine own 
 From every land away,
 And those now sundered then shall be 
 United for eternity.
