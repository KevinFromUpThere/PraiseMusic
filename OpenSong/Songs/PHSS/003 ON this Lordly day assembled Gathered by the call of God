  <title>3 NEANDER</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 ON this Lordly day assembled, 
 Gathered by the call of God,
 We rejoice, though once we trembled, 
 Fearing His avenging rod;
 Christ redeemed us;
 Let us trace the path He trod:
[V2]
 In the Babe in David's city,
 Lowly in a manger laid,
 We behold the Lord Almighty,
 Him by whom the world was made. 
 What a wonder,
 God in human form arrayed!
[V3]
 Mark the earnest Workman toiling,
 Faithful to His task and true,
 Deeming nought of labour soiling 
 That His kingly hands would do.
 Man so perfect;
 Holy, noble, humble too.
[V4]
 View the Man of Sorrows, treading
 Earth's dark vale of sin and woe, 
 Love and healing mercy spreading
 Everywhere His footsteps go.
 Pattern Servant,
 Doing all God's will below.
[V5]
 Now upon the cross suspended,
 See the Saviour crucified;
 Slain by men His love befriended, 
 Who His agonies deride.
 Yet for sinners,
 'Neath the wrath of God He died.
[V6]
 His atoning work completed
 Now He lives no more to die.
 On the Father's throne He's seated, 
 See Him victor-crowned on high.
 Hallelujah!
 'Tis by Him we now draw nigh.
[V7]
 For His birth and life obedient
 To Thy perfect holy will,
 For His death, no mere expedient,
 But Thy counsels to fulfil,
 We Thy people,
 Blessed God, would praise Thee still.
[V8]
 Praise the Father, for He gave us
 Gift most precious in His Son. 
 Praise the Son, for He to save us
 Such a mighty work has done.
 Praise the Spirit
 Who revealed it;
 Praise Jehovah, Three in One.
