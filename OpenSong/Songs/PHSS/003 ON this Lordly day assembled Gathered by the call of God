<title>3 NEANDER</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 ON this Lordly day assembled, Gathered by the call of God,
 We rejoice, though once we trembled, Fearing His avenging rod;
 Christ redeemed us;
 Let us trace the path He trod:
[V2]
 In the Babe in David's city,
 Lowly in a manger laid,
 We behold the Lord Almighty,
 Him by whom the world was made. What a wonder,
 God in human form arrayed!
[V3]
 Mark the earnest Workman toiling,
 Faithful to His task and true,
 Deeming nought of labour soiling That His kingly hands would do.
 Man so perfect;
 Holy, noble, humble too.
[V4]
 View the Man of Sorrows, treading
 Earth's dark vale of sin and woe, Love and healing mercy spreading
 Everywhere His footsteps go.
 Pattern Servant,
 Doing all God's will below.
[V5]
 Now upon the cross suspended,
 See the Saviour crucified;
 Slain by men His love befriended, Who His agonies deride.
 Yet for sinners,
 'Neath the wrath of God He died.
[V6]
 His atoning work completed
 Now He lives no more to die.
 On the Father's throne He's seated, See Him victor-crowned on high.
 'Tis by Him we now draw nigh.
[V7]
 To Thy perfect holy will,
 For His death, no mere expedient,
 But Thy counsels to fulfil,
 We Thy people,
 Blessed God, would praise Thee still.
[V8]
 Praise the Father, for He gave us
 Gift most precious in His Son. Praise the Son, for He to save us
 Such a mighty work has done.
 Praise the Spirit
 Who revealed it;
 Praise Jehovah, Three in One.
