<lyrics>[V1]
 WE laud the everlasting Word, The Father's only Son,
 God manifestly seen and heard,
 And heaven's beloved One.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V2]
 In Him, most perfectly expressed,
 The Father's glories shine;
 Of the full Deity possessed,
 Eternally divine.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V3]
 True image of the Infinite
 Whose essence is concealed; Brightness o uncreated light,
 The heart of God revealed.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V4]
 But the high mysteries of His name An angel's grasp transcend;
 The Father only (glorious claim)
 The Son can comprehend.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V5]
 Yet loving Him, on whom God's love Ineffable doth rest,
 His members allï¿½below, aboveï¿½
 As one with Him are blest.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
[V6]
 Of the vast universe of bliss
 The centre He and sun;
 Th' eternal theme of praise is thisï¿½God's well-beloved One.
 Worthy the name of Jesus now
 That every knee therein should bow.
