  <lyrics>[V1]
 THOU wondrous God, we love to trace 
 The riches of Thy matchless grace;
 Thou, ere the worlds were made, didst plan 
 To seek and save poor ruined man.
 We cannot praise Thee as we ought. 
 Thy love excels our highest thought!
[V2]
 Thou didst Thy Son in pity give,
 That sinners through His death might live; 
 He suffered on the shameful tree
 To rescue us from misery.
 We cannot praise Him as we ought,
 His love excels our highest thought!
[V3]
 The Holy Spirit, Teacher blest, 
 Who guides us to our heavenly rest,
 Makes these poor hearts His dwelling place, 
 To whisper there the tale of grace.
 We cannot praise Him as we ought, 
 His love excels our highest thought!
[V4]
 When Christ shall bring us in to Thee, 
 We'll praise Thy grace more worthily; 
 With all the blood-bought hosts above 
 We'll magnify Thy boundless love;
 We fain would praise Thee as we ought, 
 Thy love excels our highest thought!
