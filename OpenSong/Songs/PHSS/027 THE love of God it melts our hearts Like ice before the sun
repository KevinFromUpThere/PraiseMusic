  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE love of God, it melts our hearts, 
 Like ice before the sun;
 And fills our eyes with grateful tears,
 Such wonders it has done.
[V2]
 When Justice stern in wrath arose
 With sword uplift and keen, 
 Poor helpless sinners to dispatch,
 God's love did intervene.
[V3]
 Between that mighty sword and us
 Came God's beloved Son.
 That fearful stroke, it fell on Him,
 And life for us was won.
[V4]
 God's love to us will never cease, 
 Unlimited it flows;
 As from an everlasting spring 
 It faileth not, but grows.
[V5]
 Then unto God be glory given,
 And let us praise Him now
 For wondrous love through Christ
 While at His throne we bow.
