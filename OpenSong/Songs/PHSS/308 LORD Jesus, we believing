<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus, we believing
 In Thee have peace with God, Eternal life receiving,
 The purchase of Thy blood. 
 Our curse and condemnation
 Thou barest in our stead; 
 Secure is our salvation
 In Thee, our risen Head.
[V2]
 The Paraclete revealing
 Thy work has made us blest;
 Thy stripes have given us healing,
 Upon Thy love we rest.
  In Thee the Father sees us
 Accepted and complete;
 Thy blood from sin which frees us,
 For glory makes us meet.
[V3]
 We know that nought can sever 
 Our souls, O Lord, from Thee, 
 And thus united ever
 To all Thy saints are we.
 We know Thy word declaring
 The Father's wondrous love,
 In which we all are sharing
 With Thee, our Head above.
[V4]
 May we this love be showing
 To all Thy members here, 
 The channels for its flowing
 Until Thou shalt appear, 
 Until Thy Church in union,
 Around the heavenly throne, 
 Shall stand in blest communion
 In Thee, Lord, joined in one.
