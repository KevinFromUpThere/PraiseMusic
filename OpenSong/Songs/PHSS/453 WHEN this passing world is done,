<lyrics>[V1]
 WHEN this passing world is done, 
 When has sunk yon radiant sun; 
 When I stand with Christ in glory, 
 Looking o'er life's finished story; 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
 Not till then, how much I owe.
[V2]
 When I stand before the throne 
 Dressed in beauty not my own; 
 When I see Thee as Thou art, 
 Love Thee with unsinning heart; 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
 Not till then, how much I owe.
[V3]
 When the praise of heaven I hear, 
 Loud as thunders to the ear, 
 Loud as many waters' noise, 
 Sweet as harp's melodious voice; 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
 Not till then, how much I owe.
[V4]
 E'en on earth, as through a glass 
 Darkly, let Thy glory pass; 
 Make forgiveness feel so sweet, 
 Make Thy Spirit's help so meet;
 E'en on earth, Lord, make me know 
 Something of how much I owe.
[V5]
 Chosen not for good in me,
 Wakened up from wrath to flee; 
 Hidden in the Saviour's side,
 By the Spirit sanctified;
 Teach me, Lord, on earth to show 
 By my love, how much I owe.
