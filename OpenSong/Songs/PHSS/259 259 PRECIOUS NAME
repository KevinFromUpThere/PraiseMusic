 259 PRECIOUS NAME
 TAKE the name of Jesus with you
 In your path of weal and woe; 
 It will joy and comfort give you,
 Take it then where'er you go.
 Precious name! oh, how sweet! 
 Hope of earth and joy of heaven.
[V2]
 Take the name of Jesus ever,
 As a shield from every snare.
 If temptations round you gather,
 Breathe that holy name in prayer.
[V3]
 Oh, the precious name of Jesus,
 How it thrills our souls with joy! 
 Let us tell of Him who guards us;
 Let His songs our tongues employ.
[V4]
 At the name of Jesus bowing,
 Falling prostrate at His feet,
 King of kings in heaven we'll own Him, 
 When our journey is complete.
