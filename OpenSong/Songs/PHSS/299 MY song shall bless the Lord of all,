<lyrics>[V1]
 MY song shall bless the Lord of all, 
 My praise shall climb to His abode. 
 Thee, Saviour, by that name I call, 
 The great supreme, the mighty God.
[V2]
 Without beginning or decline, 
 Object of faith, and not of sense; 
 Eternal ages saw Him shine,
 He shines eternal ages hence,
[V3]
 As much when in the manger laid 
 Almighty Ruler of the sky,
 As when the six days' work He made 
 Filled all the wondering stars with joy.
[V4]
 Of all the crowns Jehovah bears, 
 Salvation is His dearest claim;
 That gracious sound well pleased He hears, 
 And owns Immanuel for His name.
[V5]
 A cheerful confidence I feel,
 My well-placed hopes with joy I see; 
 My bosom glows with heavenly zeal 
 To worship Him who died for me.
[V6]
 As man He pities my complaint, 
 His power and truth are all divine; 
 He will not fail, He cannot faint, 
 Salvation's sure, and must be mine.
