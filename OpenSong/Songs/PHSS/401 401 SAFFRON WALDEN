  <lyrics>[V1]
 JUST as I am, Thine own to be, 
 Friend of the young, who lovest me, 
 To consecrate myself to Thee,
 Lord Jesus Christ, I come. 
[V2]
 In the glad morning of my day, 
 My life to give, my vows to pay, 
 With no reserve and no delay,
 With all my heart, I come.
[V3]
 I would live ever in the light,
 I would work ever for the right,
 I would serve Thee with all my might,
 Therefore to Thee I come.
[V4]
 Just as I am, young, strong and free, 
 To be the best that I can be
 For truth and righteousness and Thee, 
 Lord of my life, I come.
