 332 PAX TECUM
 PEACE, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin? 
 The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
[V2]
 Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed? 
 To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
[V3]
 Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round? 
 On Jesus' bosom nought but peace is found.
[V4]
 Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away? 
 In Jesus' keeping we are safe and they.
[V5]
 Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown? 
 Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
[V6]
 Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours? 
 Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
[V7]
 It is enough, earth's struggles soon shall cease, 
 And Jesus call to heaven's perfect peace.
