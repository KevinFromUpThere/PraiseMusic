 282 MAGISTER (OTTAWA)
 MASTER, speak; Thy servant heareth,
 Waiting for Thy gracious word,
 Longing for Thy voice that cheereth;
 Master, let it now be heard.
 I am listening, Lord, for Thee—
 What hast Thou to say to me?
[V2]
 Speak to me by name, O Master; 
 Let me know it is to me.
 Speak, that I may follow faster
 With a step more firm and free,
 Where the Shepherd leads the flock
 In the shadow of the rock.
[V3]
 Master, speak; though least and lowest, 
 Let me not unheard depart.
 Master, speak, for oh, Thou knowest 
 All the yearning of my heart! 
 Knowest all its truest need;
 Speak, and make me blest indeed.
[V4]
 Master, speak, and make me ready,
 When Thy voice is truly heard, 
 With obedience glad and steady
 Still to follow every word;
 I am listening, Lord, for Thee—
 Master, speak, oh speak to me!
