  <title>121 EVENING HYMN</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BLEST Trinity, from mortal sight 
 Veiled in Thine own eternal light, 
 We Thee confess, in Thee believe, 
 To Thee with loving hearts we cleave.
[V2]
 O God the Father, Holy One, 
 With Thee is Thine eternal Son, 
 And Holy Spirit, evermore
 The Three in One whom we adore.
[V3]
 The Father is in God the Son, 
 And with the Father He is one; 
 In Both the Spirit doth abide, 
 And with Them Both is glorified.
[V4]
 Such as the Father, such the Son, 
 And such the Spirit, Three in One. 
 The Three one perfect Verity,
 The Three one perfect Charity.
[V5]
 Three Persons praise we evermore, 
 One only God our hearts adore.
 Thou Trinity, Thou Unity,
 Now let our praise accepted be. 
 Amen.
