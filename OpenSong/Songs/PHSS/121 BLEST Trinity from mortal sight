  <title>121 EVENING HYMN</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BLEST Trinity, from mortal sight 
 Veiled in Thine own eternal light, 
 We Thee confess, in Thee believe, 
 To Thee with loving hearts we cleave.
[V2]
 O God the Father, Holy One, 
 With Thee is Thine eternal Son, 
 And Holy Spirit, evermore
 The Three in One whom we adore.
[V3]
 The Father is in God the Son, 
 And with the Father He is one; 
 In Both the Spirit doth abide, 
 And with Them Both is glorified.
[V4]
 Such as the Father, such the Son, 
 And such the Spirit, Three in One. 
 The Three one perfect Verity,
 The Three one perfect Charity.
[V5]
 Three Persons praise we evermore, 
 One only God our hearts adore.
 Thou Trinity, Thou Unity,
 Now let our praise accepted be. 
 Amen.
 
122
[V1]
 HOLY, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 On this Lordly morning our song we raise to Thee;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[V2]
 Holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore Thee,
 Worshipping with gladness we now make melody; 
 Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee, 
 Who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.
[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy, though Thy brightness hide Thee, 
 Though the eye of mortal man Thy glory cannot see, 
 Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee, 
 Perfect in power, in love and purity.
[V4]
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea: 
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity. Amen.
 
123 CAMPBELL
 [V1]
 PRAISE ye Jehovah, praise the Lord most holy,
 Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak;
 Praise Him who will with glory crown the lowly,
 And with salvation beautify the meek.
 Praise ye the Lord for all His loving-kindness,
 And all the tender mercies He has shown;
 Praise Him who pardons all our sins and blindness, 
 And calls us sons and takes us for His own.
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 On this Lordly morn our song we raise to Thee;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.
[V2]
 Praise ye Jehovah, source of every blessing,
 Viewed with His gifts, earth's brightest boons are dim; 
 Resting on Him, His peace and joy possessing,
 All things are ours, for we have all in Him.
 Praise ye the Father, God the Lord, who gave us
 With full and perfect love His only Son;
 Praise ye the Son, who died Himself to save us;
 Praise ye the Spirit; praise the Three in One.
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
 On this Lordly morn our song we raise to Thee;
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity. Amen.
