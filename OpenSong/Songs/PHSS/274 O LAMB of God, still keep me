<lyrics>[V1]
 O LAMB of God, still keep me 
 Near to Thy wounded side;
 'Tis only there in safety
 And peace I can abide.
 What foes and snares surround me!
 What lusts and fears within!
 The grace that sought and found me
 Alone can keep me clean.
[V2]
 'Tis only in Thee hiding,
 I know my life secure;
 Only in Thee abiding, 
 The conflict can endure.
 Thine arm the victory gaineth
 O'er every hurtful foe;
 Thy love my heart sustaineth
 In all its cares and woe.
[V3]
 Soon shall my eyes behold Thee
 With rapture face to face;
 One half hath not been told me
 Of all Thy power and grace. 
 Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
 The wonders of Thy love, 
 Shall be the endless story
 Of all Thy saints above.
