  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE love that Jesus had for me 
 To suffer on the cruel tree,
 That I a ransomed soul might be,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[C]
 His love is more than tongue can tell, 
 His love is more than tongue can tell, 
 The love that Jesus had for me
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V2]
 The bitter sorrow that He bore,
 And oh! that crown of thorns He wore, 
 That I might live for evermore,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V3]
 The peace I have in Him, my Lord, 
 Who pleads before the throne of God 
 The merit of His precious blood,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V4]
 The joy that comes when He is near, 
 The rest He gives so free from fear, 
 The hope in Him so bright and clear,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
