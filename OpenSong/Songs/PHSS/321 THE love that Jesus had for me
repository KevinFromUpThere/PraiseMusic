<lyrics>[V1]
 THE love that Jesus had for me 
 To suffer on the cruel tree,
 That I a ransomed soul might be,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
 His love is more than tongue can tell, 
 His love is more than tongue can tell, 
 The love that Jesus had for me
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V2]
 The bitter sorrow that He bore,
 And oh! that crown of thorns He wore, 
 That I might live for evermore,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V3]
 The peace I have in Him, my Lord, 
 Who pleads before the throne of God 
 The merit of His precious blood,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
[V4]
 The joy that comes when He is near, 
 The rest He gives so free from fear, 
 The hope in Him so bright and clear,
 Is more than tongue can tell.
