<lyrics>[V1]
 350 DENT DALE
 OFT in danger, oft in woe,
 Onward, Christians, onward go!
 Bear the toil, maintain the strife, 
 Strengthened with the bread of life.
[V2]
 Let not sorrow dim your eye,
 Soon shall every tear be dry;
 Let not fear your course impede,
 Great your strength, if great your need.
[V3]
 Let your drooping hearts be glad, 
 March in heavenly armour clad; 
 Fight, nor think the battle long, 
 Soon shall victory wake your song.
[V4]
 Onward then to glory move,
 More than conquerors ye may prove; 
 Though opposed by many a foe, 
 Onward, Christians, onward go!
[V5]
 Hymns of glory and of praise, 
 Father, unto Thee we raise, 
 Praise unto Thine only Son, 
 And the Spirit, Three in One.
