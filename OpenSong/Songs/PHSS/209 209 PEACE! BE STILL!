 209 PEACE! BE STILL!
 MASTER, the tempest is raging,
 The billows are tossing high,
 The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness,
 No shelter or help is nigh.
 Carest Thou not that we perish?
 How canst Thou lie asleep,
 When each moment so madly is threatening
 A grave in the angry deep?
 The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
 Peace, be still!
 Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
 Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
 No waters can swallow the ship where lies 
 The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
 They all shall sweetly obey My will,
 Peace, be still!
[V2]
 Master, the terror is over,
 The elements sweetly rest.
 In calmness the lake now reposes,
 And peacefulness fills each breast. 
 Master, almighty Peacegiver,
 Speak to the sin-tossed soul
 Who cries to Thee, "Save, or I perish," 
 Deliver and take control.
