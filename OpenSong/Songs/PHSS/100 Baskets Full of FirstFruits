  <title>100 Baskets Full of FirstFruits</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BASKETS full of firstfruits,
 Sacrifice of praise
 Songs of our Redeemer
 Joyfully we raise.
 Lord, we come before Thee
 Through the living way, 
 Worshipping with gladness
 On this holy day.
[V2]
 All His deeds of kindness, 
 Every act of grace
 Led Him but to Calvary
 And the outside place. 
 There we see Him dying,
 Bowing to Thy will;
 Lamb of Thy providing,
 Loving sinners still!
[V3]
 Bought with blood most precious. 
 Pardoned through His death, 
 Now a holy priesthood
 (Thus the scripture saith),
 In Thy holy presence
 We would humbly dwell; 
 Hearts by Christ redeemed
 Songs of praises swell.
[V4]
 Lord, we only offer
 But a thousandth part
 Of the love that's owed Thee 
 From each ransomed heart.
 Praise we now the Father,
 Praise be to the Son
 And the Holy Spirit
 Praise the Three in One.
