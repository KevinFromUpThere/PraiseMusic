<lyrics>[V1]
 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
 In a believer's ear!
 It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
 And drives away his fear.
[V2]
 It makes the wounded spirit whole,
 And calms the troubled breast; 
 'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
 And to the weary rest.
[V3]
 Dear Name! the rock on which we build, 
 Our shield and hiding place;
 Our never-failing treasury, filled
 With boundless stores of grace.
[V4]
 Lord Jesus, Saviour, Shepherd, Friend, 
 Our Prophet, Priest and King,
 Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, 
 Accept the praise we bring.
[V5]
 Weak is the effort of the heart,
 And cold our warmest thought; 
 But when we see Thee as Thou art,
 We'll praise Thee as we ought.
[V6]
 Till then we would Thy love proclaim 
 With every fleeting breath;
 And glory in Thy blessed name
 That quells the power of death.
