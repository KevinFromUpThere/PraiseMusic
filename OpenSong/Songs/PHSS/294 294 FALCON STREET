<lyrics>[V1]
 294 FALCON STREET
 BREAK forth and sing the song 
 Of glory to His name;
 Wake every heart and every tongue 
 To celebrate His fame.
[V2]
 Sing of His dying love,
 His resurrection power;
 Sing how He intercedes above 
 For those whose sins He bore.
[V3]
 Sing on your heavenly road, 
 Ye heirs of glory, sing
 Of the ascended Christ of God;
 Your cheerful praises bring.
[V4]
 Soon we shall hear Him say, 
 "Ye ransomed pilgrims, come;"
 Soon will He call us hence away
 And take us to His home.
[V5]
 Then shall each raptured tongue 
 His fullest praise proclaim,
 And sweeter voices wake the song 
 Of glory to the Lamb.
 Chorus at the end of the hymn.
 Praise ye the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 Hallelujah! Praise ye the Lord.
