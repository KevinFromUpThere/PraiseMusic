<title>21 DUNSTAN</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 CROWNED with thorns upon the tree, Silent in His agony,
 Dying crushed beneath the load
 Of the wrath and curse of God.
[V2]
 On His pale and suffering brow, Mystery of love and woe;
 On His grief and sore amaze We would fix our earnest gaze.
[V3]
 Sin-atoning sacrifice,
 Oh how precious in our eyes! He alone our rest shall be, Now and through eternity.
