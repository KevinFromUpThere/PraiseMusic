<lyrics>[V1]
 JESUS! that name all names above,
 Sweet passport of eternal love,
 Unfolding to a fallen race
 The wealth of God's infinite grace.
 What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The value of that peerless name?
[V2]
 Jesus! a note of sweeter sound Not e'en in heaven itself is found;
 It thrills with joy the heart of God, This name of the incarnate Word.
 What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The sweetness of that peerless name?
[V3]
 Jesus! the name that ne'er can fail
 To make the powers of darkness quail; To fear-wrung hearts gives lasting peace, Sin-burdened souls complete release.
 What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The prowess of that peerless name?
[V4]
 Jesus! the name which can impart
 True solace to each sorrowing heart;
 Of death subdue the sting and gloom, With heavenly glory gild the tomb.
 What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The comfort of that peerless name?
[V5]
 Jesus! the name through which alone Believing ones approach the throne;
 To God their hearts' desires outpour
 And draw from heaven's exhaustless store. What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The riches of that peerless name?
[V6]
 Jesus! the name in which shall bow Each knee in heaven, on earth, below; God glorify with one accord,
 Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord. May we each day by day proclaim The glory of that peerless name.
[V7]
 And when we pass to realms above, See Him who taught us heavenly love, 
 With ransomed hosts enraptured raise Triumphant songs of ceaseless praise, 
 Unhindered then shall we proclaim The virtues of that peerless name!
