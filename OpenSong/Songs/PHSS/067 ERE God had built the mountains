<lyrics>[V1]
 ERE God had built the mountains,
 Or raised the fruitful hills; Before He filled the fountains
 That feed the running rills; In One from everlasting,
 The wonderful I AM
 Found pleasures never wasting, And Wisdom was His name.
[V2]
 When, like a tent to dwell in,
 He spread the skies abroad,
 And swathed about the swelling
 Of ocean's mighty flood,
 He wrought by weight and measure; Wisdom was with Him then; Himself the Father's pleasure,
 And His the sons of men. 
 Thus Wisdom's words discover His glory and His grace, The everlasting Lover
 Of, our unworthy race.
 His gracious eye surveyed us
 Ere stars were seen above; In wisdom He has made us,
 And died for us in love.
[V4]
 The Lord is now delighted
 To have us for His own, The love no longer slighted
 Which He to us has shown; In spite of all our badness,
 Oh, miracle of grace!
 He brings us in with gladness
 Before His Father's face.
