<lyrics>[V1]
 ABBA, Father, we approach Thee
 In our Saviour's precious name; 
 We Thy children, here assembling,
 Now Thy promised blessing claim.
 From our sins His blood has freed us,
 'Tis through Him we now draw nigh; 
 And Thy Spirit, too, has taught us,
 " Abba, Father," thus to cry.
[V2]
 Once as prodigals we wandered
 In our folly far from Thee;
 But Thy grace o'er sin abounding 
 Rescued us from misery.
 Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned,
 Kissed us with a father's love,
 Killed the fatted calf, and called us
 E'er to dwell with Thee above.
[V3]
 Clothed in garments of salvation,
 Given the children's favoured place, 
 We rejoice and Thou rejoicest
 In the riches of Thy grace.
 Abba, Father, all adore Thee,
 All rejoice in heaven above,
 While in us they learn the wonders
 Of Thy wisdom, power and love.
[V4]
 Soon before Thy throne assembled, 
 All Thy children shall proclaim¬
 "Glory, everlasting glory
 Be to God and to the Lamb." 
 Abba, then we'll cry, exulting, 
 In that holy, happy place,
 Thine eternal love beholding,
 Mirrored in the Saviour's face.
