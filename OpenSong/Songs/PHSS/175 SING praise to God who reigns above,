<lyrics>[V1]
 SING praise to God who reigns above, 
 The God of all creation,
 The God of power, the God of love, 
 The God of our salvation.
 With healing balm our souls He fills, 
 And every faithless murmur stills; To God all praise and glory.
[V2]
 The angel-hosts, O King of kings,
 Thy praise for ever telling,
 In earth and sky all living things
 Beneath Thy shadow dwelling,
 Adore the wisdom which could span, 
 And power which formed creation's plan; 
 To God all praise and glory.
[V3]
 What God's almighty power hath made
 His gracious mercy keepeth.
 By morning glow or evening shade
 His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth. 
 Within the kingdom of His might, 
 Lo, all is just, and all is right;
 To God all praise and glory.
[V4]
 O ye who bear Christ's holy name
 Give God all power and glory;
 All ye who own His power proclaim
 And sing the wondrous story. 
 Cast each false idol from its throne, 
 The Lord is God and He alone;
 To God all praise and glory.
