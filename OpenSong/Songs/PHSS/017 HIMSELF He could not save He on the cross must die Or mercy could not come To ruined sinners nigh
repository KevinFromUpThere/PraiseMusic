<title>17 HUSHED WAS THE EVENING HYMN</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HIMSELF He could not save, He on the cross must die, Or mercy could not come To ruined sinners nigh.
 Yes, Christ the Son of God must bleed,
 That sinners might from sin be freed.
[V2]
 Himself He could not save, For justice must be done, Our sins' full weight must fall Upon the sinless One.
 For nothing less could God accept In payment of that fearful debt.
[V3]
 Himself He could not save, Love's stream too deeply flowed,
 In love Himself He gave
 To pay the debt we owed. Obedience to the Father's will And love to Him did all fulfil.
[V4]
 Himself He could not save,
 But now exalted high,
 A Prince and Saviour He
 Has saved and brought us nigh. We live in Him who lives above,
 And sing with joy His deathless love.
 18t EWING
 THE Author of salvation Was offered on the tree,
 His deep humiliation
 In symbol here we see.
 We, by the Spirit guided,
 To Golotha repair;
 The Lamb that God provided Was slaughtered for us there.
[V2]
 The sword of God was bidden
 His Holy One to smite,
 Jehovah's face was hidden
 In terrors from His sight.
 God's tokens had declared Him
 His Son who pleased Him well;
 He pierced His soul, nor spared Him
 When bruised by earth and hell.
[V3]
 Justice, our guilt to cover. Awoke the wrathful storm;
 Dismay seized friend and lover,
 He said, " I am a worm.-
 He was of God forsaken,
 As One by God abhorred,
 The sinner's place was taken By Him our glorious Lord.
[V4]
 His God who duly prized Him,
 Whose statutes He did keep,
 In floods of death baptized Him,
 In sorrow's lowest deep.
 He was the Father's treasure, The Christ whom He had sent; His righteous sore displeasure
 On Him for us was spent.
[V5]
 We on to ruin hurried,
 To misery's abyss,
 But dead with Him and buried,
 And raised to share His bliss, We sing with hearts united
 His cross for evermore;
 Once like the world benighted,
 His name we now adore. Amen.
