<lyrics>[V1]
 NOT to ourselves we owe That we, O God, are Thine;
 Jesus, the Sun, our night broke through And gave us light divine.
[V2]
 The Father's grace and love
 This blessed mercy gave;
 The Son came from His throne above His wandering sheep to save.
[V3]
 No more the heirs of wrath, The smile of peace we see,
 And triumphing o'er sin and death
 We praise and worship Thee.
[V4]
 We drink the living stream
 To all Thy people given,
 The love which Thou hast made to beam From Christ the Heir of heaven.
[V5]
 With the adopted band,
 We soon shall see Him there,
 With Him and them before Thee stand,
 And in His glory share.
