 287 OLDHAM STREET
 "PRAISE ye the Lord!" again, again 
 The Spirit strikes the chord;
 Nor toucheth He our hearts in vain,
 We praise, we praise the Lord.
[V2]
 "Rejoice in Him!" again, again
 The Spirit speaks the word;
 And faith takes up the happy strain, 
 Our joy is in the Lord.
[V3]
 "Stand fast in Christ!" ah, yet again 
 He teaches all the band;
 All human efforts are in vain,
 In Christ alone we stand.
[V4]
 "Clean, every whit!" Thou saidst it, Lord
 Shall one suspicion lurk?	
 Thine, surely, is a faithful word,
 And Thine a finished work.
[V5]
 For ever be the glory given
 Unto the Christ of God;
 Our every joy on earth, in heaven,
 We owe to His shed blood.
