<lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET that word of Thine, Lord Jesus,
 "I the resurrection am;"
 From among the dead it frees us,
 We believing in Thy name.
 Holy Saviour,
 Let us now Thy love proclaim.
[V2]
 Should we die, then resurrection,
 Then the glorious mystery;
 Raised to know a long perfection,
 In Thy likeness we shall be.
 In a moment
 Raised to incorruption we.
[V3]
 We who live, on earth remaining
 Till Thy coming, ne'er shall die, 
 Never need a resurrection,
 Changed and gathered in the sky; 
 In a moment
 Made immortal,
 In the twinkling of an eye.
[V4]
 Thus in living or in dying
 We have here a wondrous word; 
 On that faithful word relying,
 We are happy in the Lord;
 For in living
 Or in dying,
 Life and joy it doth afford.
[V5]
 Grieve we not for loved ones sleeping,
 For they soon will rise again;
 Better look for days of greeting,
 Days of resurrection gain.
 Blissful greetings
 Wait us mid that glittering train.
[V6]
 Oh what songs of Hallelujah
 Then will burst with glad accord!
 Loud triumphant songs ascending, 
 Giving glory to the Lord;
 Songs ascending
 Never ending,
 Harpers harping with each word.
[V7]
 Mid the promised incorruption,
 Mid the glorious mystery,
 Death and sin in long destruction 
 Swallowed up in victory;
 In the image
 Of the heavenly we shall be.
[V8]
 Hallelujah, mid the skies;
 From our ransomed tongues shall rise;
 Oh what glory
 To have gained our long-loved prize!
