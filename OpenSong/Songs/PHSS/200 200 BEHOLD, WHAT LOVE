<lyrics>[V1]
 200 BEHOLD, WHAT LOVE
 BEHOLD what love, what boundless love, 
 The Father hath bestowed
 On sinners lost, that we should be
 Now called the sons of God!
 Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
 That we should be called the sons of God!
[V2]
 No longer far from Him, but now
 By precious blood made nigh,
 Accepted in the Well-beloved, 
 Near to God's heart we lie.
[V3]
 What we in glory soon shall be, 
 It doth not yet appear;
 But when our blessed Lord we see, 
 We shall His image bear.
[V4]
 With such a blessed hope in view, 
 We would more holy be,
 More like our risen, glorious Lord
 Whose face we shall soon see.
