<lyrics>[V1]
 FOR the bread and for the wine, For the pledge that seals Him mine, For the words of love divine,
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V2]
 Only bread, and only wine,
 Yet to faith the solemn sign Of the heavenly and divine;
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V3]
 For the words that turn the eye To the cross at Calvary,
 Bidding us in faith draw nigh, We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V4]
 For the words that fragrance breathe, These plain symbols underneath, Words that His own peace bequeath,
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
[V5]
 For the words that tell of home, Pointing us beyond the tomb, "Do ye this until I come;"
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V6]
 Till He come we take the bread, Type of Him on whom we feed, Him who liveth and was dead;
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V7]
 Till He come we drink the wine, Of His blood the solemn sign, Telling each of love divine;
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[V8]
 For that coming here foreshown, For that day to man unknown, For the glory and the throne,
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
