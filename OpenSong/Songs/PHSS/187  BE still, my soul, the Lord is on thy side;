<lyrics>[V1]
  BE still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side;
 Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. 
 Leave to thy God to order and provide; 
 In every change He faithful will remain.
 Be still, my soul, thy best, thy heavenly Friend 
 Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
[V2]
 Be still, my soul, thy God doth undertake
 To guide the future as He has the past.
 Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; 
 All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
 Be still, my soul, the waves and winds still know 
 His voice, who ruled them while He dwelt below.
[V3]
 Be still, my soul, the hour is hastening on 
 When we shall be for ever with the Lord; 
 When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, 
 Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
 Be still, my soul, when change and tears are past, 
 All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
