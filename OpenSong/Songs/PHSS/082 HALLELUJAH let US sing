  <lyrics>[V1]
 HALLELUJAH! let US sing
 As we now thank offerings bring; " Hallelujah " is the word,
 Sound aloud, "Praise ye the Lord;" Hallelujah! He has given
 Best of gifts, His Son from heaven. Hallelujah! this is love
 Worthy of our God above. 
[2] 
 Hallelujah! Christ for sin
 Death's dark flood has entered in, Suffered all the judgment throes, Saved us from eternal woes. Hallelujah! He arose
 Victor over all His foes; Now exalted, glorified,
 Sits He at His Father's side.
[3]
 Hallelujah! for the grace
 Giving us in Christ a place, Clothing our unworthiness
 With God's perfect righteousness. Hallelujah! let us raise
 Songs resounding with His praise; Hallelujah! strike the chord, Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Amen.</lyrics>
