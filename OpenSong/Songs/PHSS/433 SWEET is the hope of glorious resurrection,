<lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET is the hope of glorious resurrection,
 But sweeter still that promise, Lord, from Thee, 
 Breathing the longings of Thy deep affection,
 "I come to take you with Myself to be."
[V2]
 Blest words to those through pain and sorrow wading, 
 " 'Tis to My Father's house I needs must go,
 There to prepare a place where joy unfading
 In Mine own presence ye may ever know."
[V3]
 Hope in bereavement His assurance giveth,
 Lifting dark clouds of sorrow from the heart. 
 Soon will the advent of the One who liveth,
 Loved ones in Christ unite, no more to part.
[V4]
 Shine too, O Hope, in purifying splendour!
 Illume my soul amid earth's squalid night;
 Cleanse from defilement service I would render,
 That unashamed I hail Thy presence bright.
[V5]
 Grant, Lord, no other hope my heart engages,
 Earth's fleeting dreams ne'er grow to me more dear; 
 That never faintly, as from distant ages,
 Shall fall that promise on my listless ear.
[V6]
 E'er may the hope of Thy return be calling
 With trumpet note to work, to watch, to pray;
 Soon work must cease; for, see, the night is falling;
 Haste to the labour while 'tis called today.
[V7]
 May each swift hour, Lord, tell me 
 Thou art nearer, Nearer to me 
 Thy presence is, and home;
 Moment by moment may Thy voice sound clearer,
 " Quickly I come." Amen! Lord Jesus, come!
