<lyrics>[V1]
 OUR God, we thank Thee, who hast made 
 The earth so bright,
 So full of splendour and of joy,
 Beauty and light;
 So many glorious things are here,
 Noble and right.
[V2]
 We thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made 
 Joy to abound,
 So many gentle thoughts and deeds, 
 Circling us round,
 That in the darkest spot of earth
 Some love is found.
[V3]
 We thank Thee more, that all our joy
 Is touched with pain,
 That shadows fall on brightest hours,
 That thorns remain;
 So that earth's bliss may be our guide, 
 And not our chain.
[V4]
 For Thou who knowest, Lord, how soon 
 Our weak heart clings,
 Hast given us joys, tender and true, 
 Yet all with wings,
 So that we see, gleaming on high,
 Diviner things.
[V5]
 The best in store;
 We have enough, but not too much
 To long for more;
 A yearning for a deeper peace
 Not known before.
