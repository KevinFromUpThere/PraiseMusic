 351 MY FATHER KNOWS
 I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,
 Rough and thorny is the road; 
 Often in the midst of danger,
 But it leads to God.
 Clouds and darkness oft distress me,
 Great and many are my foes, 
 Anxious care and thoughts perplex me,
 But my Father knows.
[V2]
 Oh, how sweet is this assurance
 Midst the conflict and the strife, 
 Although sorrows past endurance
 Follow me through life!
 Home in prospect still can cheer me,
 Yes, and give me sweet repose,
 While I feel His presence near me;
 For my Father knows.
[V3]
 Yes, He sees and knows me daily,
 Watches over me in love,
 Sends me help when foes assail me,
 Bids me look above.
 Soon my journey will be ended;
 Life is drawing to a close; 
 I shall then be well attended;
 This my Father knows.
[V4]
 I shall then with joy behold Him,
 Face to face my Father see;
 Fall with rapture and adore Him,
 For His love to me.
 Nothing more shall then distress me
 In that land of sweet repose;
 Jesus stands engaged to bless me,
 This my Father knows.
