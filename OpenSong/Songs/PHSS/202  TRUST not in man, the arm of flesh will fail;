<lyrics>[V1]
  TRUST not in man, the arm of flesh will fail; 
 Trust not in man, his strength cannot avail; 
 Trust not in man, though great may be his boast; 
 Trust not in man—who trusts in him is lost.
[V2]
 Trust thou in God, though all around deride; 
 Trust thou in God when good or ill betide;
 Trust thou in God, though strongest men may fall; 
 Trust thou in God, make Him thy all in all.
[V3]
 Trust thou in God in dark and stormy days; 
 Trust thou in God in smooth and pleasant ways; 
 Trust thou in God, for Satan aye is near;
 Trust thou in God, and then thou need'st not fear.
[V4]
 Trust thou in God, He is a rock, a tower;
 Trust thou in God, thy stronghold is His power; 
 Trust thou in God, His promises are sure;
 Trust thou in God, in Him thou art secure.
[V5]
 Trust thou in God, in secret to Him pray,
 Trust thou in God, He'll be thy strength and stay; 
 Trust thou in God, make Him thy dearest friend, 
 Trust thou in God, He'll keep thee to the end.
 Section 10. 
 Our Lord Jesus Christ
