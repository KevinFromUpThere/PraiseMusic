<lyrics>[V1]
 OH, teach us more of Thy blest ways, 
 Thou holy Lamb of God;
 And fix and root us in Thy grace,
 As those redeemed by blood.
[V2]
 Oh, tell us often of Thy love,
 Of all Thy grief and pain;
 And let our hearts with joy confess
 That thence comes all our gain.
[V3]
  For this, oh, may we freely count
 Whate'er we have but loss;
 The dearest object of our love, 
 Compared with Thee but dross!
[V4]
 Engrave this deeply on our heart 
 With an eternal pen,
 That we may, in some small degree,
 Return Thy love again. Amen.
