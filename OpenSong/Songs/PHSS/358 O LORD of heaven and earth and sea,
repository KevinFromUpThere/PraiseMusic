<title>358 ALMSGIVING</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD of heaven and earth and sea, 
 To Thee all praise and glory be; 
 How shall we show our love to Thee,
 Who givest all?
[V2]
 Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, 
 But gav'st Him for a world undone, 
 And freely with the blessed One
 Thou givest all.
[V3]
 We lose what on ourselves we spend; 
 We have as treasure without end
  Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,
 Who givest all;
[V4]
 To Thee, from whom we all derive 
 Our life, our gifts, our power to give 
 Oh, may we ever with Thee live,
 Who givest all!
