<title>113 ADORATION</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 GIVE thanks to God Most High, The universal Lord,
 The Sovereign King of kings, And be His name adored.
 Thy mercy, Lord, shall aye endure; Thy word abides for ever sure.
[V2]
 How mighty is His hand! What wonders He hath done! He formed the earth and seas And spread the heaven alone.
 Thy power and grace are still the same;
 Let endless praise exalt Thy name.
[V3]
 His wisdom framed the sun
 To crown the day with light, The moon and twinkling stars To cheer the darksome night.
 Thy mercy, Lord, shall aye endure;
 Thy word abides for ever sure.
[V4]
 He smote the first-born sons, The flower of Egypt, dead; And thence the chosen tribes With joy and glory led.
 Thy power and grace are still the same; Let endless praise exalt Thy name.
[V5]
 He sent His only Son
 To save us from our woe,
 From Satan, sin, and death
 And every hurtful foe.
 Thy mercy, Lord, shall aye endure; Thy word abides for ever sure.
[V6]
 Give thanks aloud to God, To God the heavenly King; With all around His throne His works and glories sing.
 Thy power and grace are still the same;
 Let endless praise exalt Thy name.
