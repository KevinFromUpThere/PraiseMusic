 330 NONE BUT CHRIST
 O CHRIST, in Thee my soul hath found, 
 And found in Thee alone,
 The peace, the joy I sought so long, 
 The bliss till now unknown.
 Now none but Christ can satisfy,
 None other name for me;
 There's love and life and lasting joy,
 Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
[V2]
 I sighed for rest and happiness;
 I yearned for them, not Thee.
 But while I passed the Saviour by,
 His love laid hold on me.
[V3]
 I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, 
 But ah, the waters failed!
 E'en as I stooped to drink they fled, 
 And mocked me as I wailed.
[V4]
 The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, 
 But never wept for Thee,
 Till grace the sightless eyes received, 
 Thy loveliness to see.
