  <title>47 OLD WINCHESTER</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE head that once was crowned with thorns
 Is crowned with glory now,
 A royal diadem adorns
 The mighty Victor's brow. 
[V2]
 Delight of all who dwell above, 
 The joy of saints below,
 To us He manifests His love 
 That we its depths may know.
[V3]
 To us His cross with all its shame, 
 With all its grace is given;
 Though earth disowns the lowly name, 
 All worship it in heaven.
[V4]
 To us His cross is life and health,
 Though shame and death to Him; 
 Our present glory, joy, and wealth,
 Our never-ending theme.
