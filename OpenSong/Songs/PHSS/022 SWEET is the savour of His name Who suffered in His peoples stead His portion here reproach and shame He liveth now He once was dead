<lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET is the savour of His name Who suffered in His people's stead; His portion here reproach and shame, He liveth now, He once was dead.
[V2]
 He once was dead, the very same Who sits on yonder throne above, Who bears in heaven the greatest name, Whom angels serve, whom angels love.
[V3]
 He once was dead, the very same Who made the worlds, a work of power, Who now upholds the mighty frame, And keeps it till the final hour.
[V4]
 He once was dead; but now He lives, His glory fills all heaven above;
 Its blessedness to heaven He gives, The fountain He of joy and love.
[V5]
 His people shall His triumph share, With Him shall live and with Him reign, In heaven their joy is full, for there They see Him who for them was slain.
 LET us join our God to bless For His Son our righteousness,
 Him who bowed His head so low Underneath our load of woe.
[V2]
 His the curse, the wounds, the gall, His the stripes, He bore them all; His the dying cry of pain
 When our sins He did sustain.
[V3]
 He, the accepted sacrifice,
 From the vanquished grave did rise. Free Himself, He set us free
 In His perfect liberty.
[V4]
 Praise our God who willed it thus, Praise His Son who died for us, Praise the Father for the Son
 Who so vast a work hath done.
