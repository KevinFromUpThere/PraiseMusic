<title>377 GALILEE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 JESUS calls us! O'er the tumult
 Of our life's wild, restless sea,
 Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
 Saying, "Christian, follow Me."
[V2]
 As of old apostles heard it
 By the Galilean lake,
 Turned from home and toil and kindred, 
 Leaving all for His dear sake,
[V3]
 Jesus calls us from the worship
 Of the vain world's golden store; 
 From each idol that would keep us, 
 Saying, "Christian, love Me more."
[V4]
 In our joys and in our sorrows,
 Days of toil and hours of ease,
 Still He calls, in cares and pleasures, 
 "Christian, love Me more than these."
[V5]
 Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,
 Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
 Give our hearts to Thine obedience,
 Serve and love Thee best of all.
