<lyrics>[V1]
 God's almighty arms are round me,
 Peace, peace is mine.
 Judgment scenes need not confound me,
 Peace, peace is mine. 
 Jesus came Himself and sought me,
 Sold to death, He found and bought me, 
 Then my blessed freedom taught me;
 Peace, peace is mine.
[V2]
 While I hear life's surging billows,
 Peace, peace is mine. 
 Why suspend my harp on willows?
 Peace, peace is mine.
 I may sing with Christ beside me 
 Though a thousand ills betide me, 
 Safely He hath sworn to guide me;
 Peace, peace is mine.
[V3]
 Every trial draws Him nearer,
 Peace, peace is mine.
 All His strokes but make Him dearer,
 Peace, peace is mine. 
 Bless I then the hand that smiteth 
 Gently, and to heal delighteth; 
 'Tis against my sins He fighteth;
 Peace, peace is mine.
[V4]
 Welcome, every rising sunlight,
 Peace, peace is mine. 
 Nearer home each rolling midnight,
 Peace, peace is mine. 
 Death and hell cannot appal me, 
 Safe in Christ whate'er befall me, 
 Calmly wait I till He call me;
 Peace, peace is mine.
