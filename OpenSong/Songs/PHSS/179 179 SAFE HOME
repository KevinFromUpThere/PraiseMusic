 179 SAFE HOME
 JEHOVAH IS our strength,
 And He shall be our song;
 We shall o'ercome at length,
 Although our foes be strong; 
 In vain doth Satan then oppose, 
 For God is stronger than His foes.
[V2]
 The Lord our refuge is,
 And ever will remain;
 Since He hath made us His
 He will our cause maintain; 
 In vain our enemies oppose,
 For God is stronger than His foes.
[V3]
 The Lord our portion is;
 What can we wish for more? 
 As long as we are His
 We never can be poor;
 In vain do earth and hell oppose, 
 For God is stronger than His foes.
[V4]
 The Lord our Shepherd is, 
 He knows our every need; 
 And since we now are His, 
 His care our souls will feed;
 In vain do sin and death oppose,
 For God is stronger than His foes.
[V5]
 This God our Father is,
 Our names are on His heart; 
 We ever shall be His,
 He ne'er from us will part;
 In vain the world and flesh oppose, 
 For God is stronger than His foes.
