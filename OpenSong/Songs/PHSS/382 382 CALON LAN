 382 CALON LAN
 HEAVENLY Father, may Thy blessing 
 Rest upon Thy children now,
 When in praise Thy name we hallow, 
 When in prayer to Thee we bow.
 In the wondrous story reading
 Of the Lord of truth and grace,
 May we see Thy love reflected
 In the light of His dear face. 
[V2]
 May we learn from this great story 
 All the arts of friendliness,
 Truthful speech and honest action, 
 How to master self and temper,
 How to make our conduct fair;
 When to speak and when be silent, 
 When to do and when forbear.
[V3]
 May His Spirit, wise and holy,
 With His gifts our spirits bless,
 Make us loving, joyous, peaceful,
 Rich in goodness, gentleness,
 Strong in self-control, and faithful,
 Kind in thought and deed; for He Sayeth, 
 "What ye do for others Ye are doing unto Me."
