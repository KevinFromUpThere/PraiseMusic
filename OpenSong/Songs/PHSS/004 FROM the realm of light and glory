  <title>4 ALL FOR JESUS</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 FROM the realm of light and glory
 Came the Son of God as Man, 
 To unfold the wondrous story
 Veiled in God's eternal plan.
[V2]
 Leaving heaven's throne of splendour,
 Stepping down to earth's dark night
 Shepherds find Him in a manger,
 Gaze in wonder at the sight!
[V3]
 Woman's Seed in Eden promised,
 God incarnate, virgin-born;
 Morning Star by men unnoticed,
 Herald of a glorious dawn.
[V4]
 As Jehovah's Servant treading 
 Sin-stained earth with heavenly grace, 
 Ever onward, never faltering
 All His steps we love to trace.
[V5]
 On the cross, His will unshaken,
 Dying, outcast, crushed, alone; 
 Visage marred, by God forsaken,
 There for sinners to atone.
[V6]
 Victor over death and Hades,
 Foes all vanquished 'neath His feet, 
 To the Father's side He rises,
 There to take the highest seat!
[V7]
 Tribute bring we to the Father
 For the Son, His gift of love; 
 Bowing low, our praise we offer
 In the holy place above.
