<title>273 EVENTIDE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 ABIDE with me; fast falls the eventide;
 The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide. 
 When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 
 Help of the helpless, oh abide with me!
[V2]
 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; 
 Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; 
 Change and decay in all around I see;
 O Thou who changest not, abide with me!
[V3]
 Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;
 But as Thou dwelt'st with Thy disciples, Lord, 
 Come not to sojourn, but abide with me!
[V4]
 Thou on my head in early youth didst smile, 
 And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile, 
 Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee;
 On to the close, O Lord, abide with me!
[V5]
 I need Thy presence every passing hour;
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power? 
 Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? 
 Through cloud and sunshine, oh abide with me!
[V6]
 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
 Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. 
 Where is death's sting, and where death's victory? 
 I triumph still if Thou abide with me.
[V7]
 Hold Thou Thy cross before my faltering eyes, 
 Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies.
 Morn soon shall break, and earth's vain shadows flee; 
 Till that bright dawning, Lord, abide with me.
