  <title>060 Tis Past the Dark and Dreary Night</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 'Tis past, the dark and dreary night; 
 O God, we see Him now,
 Our morning Star, without a cloud 
 Of sadness on His brow.
[V2]
 His path on earth, the cross, the grave, 
 His sorrows, all are o'er;
 And oh, sweet thought! His eye shall weep, 
 His heart shall break no more.
[V3]
 Deep were those sorrows, deeper still
 The love that brought Him low,
 That bade the streams of life from Him
 A lifeless Victim flow.
[V4]
 The soldier, as he pierced Him, proved 
 Man's hate to Him and Thee,
 Whilst in the blood that stained the spear 
 His love and Thine we see.
[V5]
 It is not that we know the joy
 Of cancelled sin alone,
 But happier far, the saints are called
 To share His glorious throne.
[V6]
 So closely are we linked in love 
 (As dear as He to Thee)
 That all His bliss and glory soon
 Our portion blest shall be.
