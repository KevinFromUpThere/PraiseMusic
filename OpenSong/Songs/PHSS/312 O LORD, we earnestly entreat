<title>312 MARTYRDOM</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, we earnestly entreat
 That in this solemn hour 
 The blessed Holy Paraclete
 May manifest His power.
[V2]
 May He, like mighty rushing wind 
 Upon the waves beneath,
 Move with one impulse every mind;
 One soul, one feeling breathe.
 The Holy Spirit
[V3]
 May He the young, the old inspire
 With wisdom from above,
 And give us hearts and tongues of fire,
 To pray and praise and love.
[V4]
 Spirit of light! May He explore
 And chase our gloom away,
 With lustre shining more and more
 Unto the perfect day.
[V5]
 May He, the blessed Paraclete,
 Who with us doth abide
 God's gracious purpose to complete, 
 Be day by day our Guide. Amen
