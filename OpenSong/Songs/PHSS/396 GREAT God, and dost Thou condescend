<lyrics>[V1]
 GREAT God, and dost Thou condescend 
 To be my Father and my Friend?
 I, a poor child, and Thou so high, 
 The Lord of earth and sea and sky!
[V2]
 Yes, wondrous God, for I received
 Thy Son, and on His name believed. 
 Now I'm a true-born child of Thine, 
 And Thou, His Father, too art mine.
[V3]
 Thou art my Father; Thou canst bear 
 To hear my poor imperfect prayer,
 And Thou wilt listen to the praise 
 That I, a little one, can raise.
[V4]
 A meek, obedient child to Thee,
 And try, in word and deed and thought, 
 To serve and please Thee as I ought.
[V5]
 Thou art my Father; I'll depend 
 Upon the care of such a Friend,
 And only wish to do and be 
 Whatever seemeth good to Thee.
[V6]
 Then Thou, my Father, wilt at last, 
 When all my days on earth are past, 
 Receive me to my home above,
 To rest for ever in Thy love.
