<lyrics>[V1]
 FILL Thou my life, O Lord my God,
 In every part with praise,
 That my whole being may proclaim 
 Thy Being and Thy ways.
[V2]
 Not for the lip of praise alone,
 Nor e'en the praising heart 
 I ask, but for a life made up
 Of praise in every part;
[V3]
 Praise in the common things of life, 
 Its goings out and in;
 Praise in each duty and each deed, 
 However small and mean.
[V4]
 Fill every part of me with praise; 
 Let all my being speak
 Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
 Poor though I be and weak.
[V5]
 So shalt Thou, Lord, from me, e'en me, 
 Receive the glory due;
 And so shall I begin on earth
 The song for ever new.
[V6]
 So shall each fear, each fret, each care, 
 Be turned into song,
 And every winding of the way
 The echo shall prolong.
[V7]
 So shall no part of day or night
 From sacredness be free,
 But all my life, in every step,
 Be fellowship with Thee.
