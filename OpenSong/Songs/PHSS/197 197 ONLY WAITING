 197 ONLY WAITING
 "ABBA, Father," Lord, we call Thee,
 Hallowed name from day to day.
 'Tis Thy children's right to know Thee,
 None but children "Abba" say. 
 This high glory we inherit,
 Thy free gift through Jesus' blood; 
 God the Spirit with our spirit
 Witnesseth we're sons of God.
[V2]
 Though our nature's fall in Adam
 Shut us wholly out from God,
 Thus it was His counsel brought us
 Nearer still through Jesus' blood. 
 For in Him we found redemption,
 Grace, and glory in the Son.
 Oh, the height and depth of mercy,
 Christ and we through grace are one!
[V3]
 Richest stores of heavenly blessings
 God hath given through Christ, 
 His Son With the Holy Spirit's power
 Safe to lead His children on.
 Abba, Father, makes all certain,
 Both by word and oath and blood; 
 Abba saith, 'They are My people,"
 And they say, "He is our God."
[V4]
 Hence through all the changing seasons,
 Nothing changeth God's affections,
 Abba's love shall bring us through. 
 Soon shall all the blood-bought children
 Round the throne their anthems raise
 And in songs of rich salvation
 Shout to Abba endless praise.
