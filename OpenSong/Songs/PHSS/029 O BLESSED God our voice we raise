  <lyrics>[V1]
 O BLESSED God, our voice we raise
 To speak Thy worth and sing Thy praise, 
 For love that made Thee give Thy Son 
 For sinners ruined and undone.
[V2]
 On Him by Thee our sins were laid, 
 When He for sin atonement made; 
 Our every sin was known to Thee, 
 He bore them that we might be free.
[V3]
 Such love we cannot comprehend,
 That Thou for us Thy Son shouldst send 
 To bear such heavy load of woe,
 To pay the debt that we did owe.
[V4]
 But this we know, Thy Son did die 
 To bring us guilty sinners nigh. 
 Now all the work is fully done, 
 We stand accepted in Thy Son.
[V5]
 And now we wait the happy day 
 When He will take His own away, 
 Far from this scene of care and strife, 
 To dwell with Him in endless life.
[V6]
 Till then, O God, be this our aim, 
 To celebrate His wondrous name,
 To praise the love that made Thee give 
 Thy Son to die that we might live.
