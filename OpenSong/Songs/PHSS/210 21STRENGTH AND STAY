 210  STRENGTH AND STAY
 PROPITIOUS seemed the gentle waters laving
 Gennes'ret's shore when first the little band,
 All thought for coming storm and danger waiving,
 Set forth to cross it at their Lord's command.
[V2]
 But soon the scene in tempest darkness merges,
 The water rages, torn by shrieking winds;
 Faith staggers with the boat, and upmost surges
 O'erwhelming fear within the tremblers' minds.
[V3]
 "Dost Thou not care, O Master, that we perish,
 Who at Thy word embarked upon this sea? 
 Canst Thou at such a moment slumber cherish,
 Indifferent, though we die because of Thee?"
[V4]
 Calm and majestic rises from His pillow
 Sea's mighty Lord, commanding, "Peace, be still!" 
 Sink then to rest, with troubled wind and billow, 
 Their tossing minds, soothed by His potent will.
[V5]
 Disciples all! The Lord Himself has set us
 The course by which we voyage to our home; 
 Here lies our confidence whate'er beset us,
 We sail with One whose power must overcome.
[V6]
 'Tis easy when o'er stilly waters gliding,
 In peaceful faith upon the Lord to rest;
 But when our bark on troublous waves is riding,
 Will faith triumphant issue through the test?
[V7]
 Calm mid surrounding turmoil, mighty Master,
 Teach us to rest secure beneath Thy wing;
 Thine arm will guard Thy weak ones from disaster,
 And safely to their longed-for haven bring.
