<lyrics>[V1]
 THERE is a name I love to hear,
 I love to speak its worth;
 It sounds like music in mine ear,
 The sweetest name on earth.
[V2]
 It tells me of a Saviour's love,
 Who died to set me free;
 It tells me of His precious blood, 
 The sinner's only plea.
[V3]
 It tells me of a Father's love
 Beaming upon His child;
 It cheers me through this little while,
 Through desert, waste and wild.
[V4]
 It tells me what my Father hath
 In store for me each day;
 And though I tread a darksome path, 
 Yields sunshine all the way.
[V5]
 It tells of One whose loving heart 
 Can feel my every woe,
 Who in each sorrow bears a part
 That none can bear below.
[V6]
 It bids my trembling soul rejoice, 
 It dries each rising tear;
 It tells me in a still small voice,
 To trust and not to fear.
[V7]
 The name I love to hear;
 No saint on earth its worth can tell,
 No heart conceive how dear.
[V8]
 This name shall shed its fragrance still 
 Along the thorny road,
 Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill 
 That leads me up to God;
[V9]
 And there, with all the blood-bought throng,
 From sin and sorrow free,
 I'll sing the new, eternal song,
 His boundless love to me.
