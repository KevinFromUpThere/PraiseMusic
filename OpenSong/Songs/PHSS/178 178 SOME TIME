<lyrics>[V1]
 178 SOME TIME
 NOT now, but in the coming years, 
 It may be in the better land,
 We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
 And there, some time, we'll understand.
 Then trust in God through all thy days; 
 Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
 Though dark thy way, still sing and praise; 
 Some time, some time we'll understand.
[V2]
 We'll catch the broken threads again, 
 And finish what we here began; 
 Heaven will the mysteries explain, 
 And then, ah then, we'll understand.
[V3]
 We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
 Were over many a cherished plan;
 Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
 'Tis there, some time, we'll understand.
[V4]
 Why what we long for most of all 
 Eludes so oft our eager hand,
 Why hopes are crushed, and castles fall, 
 Up there, some time, we'll understand.
[V5]
 God knows the way, He holds the key, 
 He guides us with unerring hand. 
 Some time with tearless eyes we'll see; 
 Yes there, up there, we'll understand.
