<lyrics>[V1]
 No blood, no altar now,
 The sacrifice is o'er;
 No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
 The lamb is slain no more;
 But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
 To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.
[V2]
 We thank Thee for the bloodï¿½
 The blood of Christ, Thy Son;
 The blood by which our peace was made, Our victOry was won;
 Great victOry o'er hell, and sin, and woe,
 That needs no second fight, and leaves no second foe.
[V3]
 We thank Thee for the grace
 Descending from above,
 That overflows our widest guilt,
 Th' eternal Father's love,
 Love of the Father's co-eternal Son,
 Th' eternal Spirit's loveï¿½Jehovah, Three in One!
[V4]
 We thank Thee for the hope,
 So glad, and sure, and clear;
 It holds the drooping spirit up Till the long dawn appear.
 Fair hope, with what a sunshine does it cheer
 Our roughest path on earth, our dreariest desert here!
