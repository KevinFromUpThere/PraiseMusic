<lyrics>[V1]
 PRAISE the Saviour, ye who know Him; 
 Who can tell how much we owe Him? 
 Gladly let us render to Him
 All we have and are.
[V2]
 "Jesus" is the name that charms us; 
 He for conflict fits and arms us; 
 Nothing moves and nothing harms us
 When we trust in Him.
[V3]
 Trust in Him, ye saints, for ever; 
 He is faithful, changing never; 
 Neither force nor guile can sever
 Those He loves from Him.
[V4]
 Keep us, Lord, oh keep us cleaving 
 To Thyself, and still believing,
 Till the hour of our receiving
 Promised joys in heaven.
[V5]
 Then we shall be where we would be, 
 Then we shall be what we should be, 
 Things which are not now, nor could be,
 Then shall be our own.
