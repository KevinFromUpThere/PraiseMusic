<lyrics>[V1]
 177 CASTLE STREET
 As sinners saved we gladly praise 
 The Author of redeeming grace; 
 Father, 'tis Thine almighty power 
 Secures us when the tempests lower.
[V2]
 Thy love's a refuge ever nigh,
 Thy watchfulness a mountain high; 
 Thy name a rock which winds above 
 And waves below can never move.
[V3]
 Thy faithfulness for ever sure
 For endless ages shall endure;
 Thy perfect work shall ever prove 
 The depth of Thine unchanging love.
[V4]
 While all things change Thou changest not
 Forgetting ne'er, though oft forgot ;
  Thy love eternally the same
 Is as enduring as Thy name.
[V5]
 Lord, we would then rejoice and praise
 The source of all this wondrous grace. 
 Father, Thine everlasting power
 Will keep us safe in danger's hour.
