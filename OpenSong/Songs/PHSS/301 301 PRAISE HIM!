<lyrics>[V1]
 301 PRAISE HIM!
 PRAISE Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
 Sing, ye saints, His wonderful love proclaim;
 Hail Him! hail Him! mightiest angels in glory,
 Strength and honour give to His holy name. 
 Like a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people,
 In His arms He carries them all day long.
 O ye saints, that dwell in the light of His presence,
 Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.
[V2]
 Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
 For our sins He suffered and bled and died;
 He's our rock, our hope of eternal salvation;
 Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
 Holy Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
 Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow; 
 Once for us rejected, despised and forsaken,
 Prince of glory, He is triumphant now.
[V3]
 Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer,
 Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring;
 Jesus, Saviour, liveth for ever and ever;
 Laud Him! laud Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
 Death is vanquished; tell it with joy, ye faithful; 
 Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
 Jesus lives! no longer thy portals are cheerless, 
 Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.
