<lyrics>[V1]
 JEHOVAH reigns, He dwells in light, Girded with majesty and might. The world, created by His hands, Firm on its first foundation stands.
[V2]
 But ere this spacious world was made Or had its first foundation laid,
 Thy throne eternal ages stood,
 Thyself the ever-living God.
[V3]
 For ever shall Thy throne endure, Thy promise stands for ever sure; And holiness to endless days
 Becomes the dwelling of Thy grace.
