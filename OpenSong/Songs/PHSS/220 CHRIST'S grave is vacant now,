<lyrics>[V1]
 CHRIST'S grave is vacant now,
 Left for the throne above;
 His cross asserts God's right to bless
 In His own boundless love.
[V2]
 'Twas there the life was poured;
 There Mercy gained her diadem, 
 While Justice sheathed her sword.
[V3]
 And thence the child of faith 
 Sees judgment all gone by,
 Perceives the sentence fully met,
 "The soul that sins shall die;"
[V4]
 Learns how that God in love
 Gave Christ, the sins to bear
 Of all who own His lordship now, 
 That they His place may share;
[V5]
 And cries with wondering joy, 
 "As He is, so am I—
 Pure, holy, loved as Christ Himself;
 Who shall my peace destroy?
[V6]
 "Reach my blest Saviour first,
 Take Him from God's esteem;
 Prove Jesus bears one spot of sin, 
 Then tell me I'm unclean.
[V7]
 "Nay, for He purged my guilt
 With His own precious blood;
 And such its virtue, not a stain 
 E'er meets the eye of God."
