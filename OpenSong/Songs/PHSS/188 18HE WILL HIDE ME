<lyrics>[V1]
 188  HE WILL HIDE ME
 WHEN the storms of life are raging,
 Tempests wild on sea and land,
 I will seek a place of refuge
 In the shadow of God's hand.
 He will hide me, He will hide me, 
 Where no harm can e'er betide me; 
 He will hide me, safely hide me,
 In the shadow of His hand.
[V2]
 Though He may send some affliction, 
 'Twill but make me long for home; 
 For in love and not in anger,
 All His chastenings will come. 
[V3]
 Enemies may strive to injure,
 Satan all his arts employ;
 God will turn what seems to harm me 
 Into everlasting joy.
[V4]
 So, while here the cross I'm bearing, 
 Meeting storms and billows wild, 
 Jesus for my soul is caring,
 Nought can harm His Father's child.
