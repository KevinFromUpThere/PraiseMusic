  <lyrics>[V1]
 AWAKE each soul in joyful lays
 And sing the great Redeemer's praise. 
 He justly claims our melody;
 His loving-kindness, oh, how free!
[V2]
 He saw us ruined in the Fall,
 Yet loved us notwithstanding all. 
 He saved us from our lost estate; 
 His loving-kindness, oh, how great!
[V3]
 Soon shall we mount and soar away 
 To those bright realms of endless day, 
 And sing with rapture and surprise, 
 His loving-kindness in the skies.
