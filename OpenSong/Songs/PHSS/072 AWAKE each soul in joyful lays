<lyrics>[V1]
 AWAKE each soul in joyful lays
 And sing the great Redeemer's praise. He justly claims our melody;
 His loving-kindness, oh, how free!
[V2]
 He saw us ruined in the Fall,
 Yet loved us notwithstanding all. He saved us from our lost estate; His loving-kindness, oh, how great!
[V3]
 Soon shall we mount and soar away To those bright realms of endless day, And sing with rapture and surprise, His loving-kindness in the skies.
