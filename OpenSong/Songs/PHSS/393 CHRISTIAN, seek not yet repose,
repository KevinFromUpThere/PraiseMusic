<title>393 VIGILATE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 CHRISTIAN, seek not yet repose, 
 Cast thy dreams of ease away; 
 Thou art in the midst of foes 
 "Watch and pray."
[V2]
 Principalities and powers, 
 Mustering their unseen array, 
 Wait for thine unguarded hours 
 "Watch and pray."
[V3]
 Gird thy heavenly armour on, 
 Wear it ever night and day; 
 Ambushed lies the evil one 
 "Watch and pray." 
[V4]
 Hear the victors who o'ercame; 
 Still they mark each warrior's way; 
 All with one clear voice exclaim 
 "Watch and pray."
[V5]
 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, 
 Him thou lovest to obey;
 Hide within thy heart His word¬
 " Watch and pray."
[V6]
 Watch, as if on that alone
 Hung the issue of the day;
 Pray that help may be sent down 
 "Watch and pray."
