<title>168 ADORATION</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 COME, Thou fount of every blessing, 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy praise; 
 Streams of mercy never ceasing
 Call for ceaseless songs of praise.
 Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,
 Meet for blood-bought hosts above,
 While I sing the countless treasure
 Of my God's unchanging love.
[V2]
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
 Wandering from the fold of God;
 He, to rescue me from danger, 
 Interposed His precious blood.
 Oh, to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I'm constrained to be'
 Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter 
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
[V3]
 Prone to wander, Lord, I know it,
 Prone to leave the God I love.
 Keep my heart from wandering, keep it
 Till I'm perfected above.
 Here I raise my Ebenezer,
 Hither by Thy help I'm come; 
 Teach me, Lord, to do Thy pleasure, 
 Till I reach my heavenly home.
