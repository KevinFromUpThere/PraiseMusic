<title>432 DAWNING</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I AM waiting for the dawning 
 Of the bright and blessed day,
 When this darksome night of sorrow
 Shall have vanished far away;
 When for ever with the Saviour, 
 Far beyond this vale of tears,
 I shall swell the song of worship 
 Through the everlasting years.
[V2]
 I am looking for the brightness
 (See it shineth from afar)
 Of the clear and joyous beaming 
 Of the bright and morning Star.
 Through the dark grey mist of morning 
 Do I see its glorious light;
 Then away with every shadow 
 Of this sad and weary night.
[V3]
 I am waiting for the coming
 Of the Lord, who died for me;
 Oh, His words have thrilled my spirit,
 "I will come again for thee!"
 I can almost hear His footfall
 On the threshold of the door,
 And my heart, my heart is longing 
 To be with Him evermore.
