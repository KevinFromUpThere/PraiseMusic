 169 PEEL CASTLE
 IN safety standing on the Red Sea's shore, 
 The sons of Israel viewed the closing grave 
 Of groaning tyranny and bondage sore,
 As Egypt's hosts sank 'neath the surging wave.
[V2]
 Long, weary years had Pharaoh's jealous might, 
 With unrelenting rigour, crushed them low;
 But God Almighty bared His arm in fight,
  And to destruction hurled the haughty foe.
[V3]
 Saved now and free! oh, soul-inspiring thought! 
 Well might ascend from Israel's ransomed throng 
 To Him whose works had their salvation wrought, 
 Deep thanks expressed in loud and rapturous song.
[V4]
 Ten, tens of thousands sang the matchless fame 
 Of their Deliverer in triumphant lays,
 Proclaiming far Jehovah's glorious name
 As truly worthy of eternal praise.
[V5]
 So let us sing, for greater cause have we
 Than Israel had to praise the living God.
 From earthly tyrant's bonds were they set free—
 We groaned in sin, 'neath Satan's despot rod.
[V6]
 Let joyous songs from thankful hearts ascend 
 To God our Saviour, who, from light above, 
 Did in His Son a great Deliverer send,
 Who freed us by His work of mighty love.
