<lyrics>[V1]
 201 GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS
  GREAT is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
 Thou changest not; Thy compassions, they fail not;
 As Thou hast been Thou for ever wilt be.
 Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness! 
 Morning by morning new mercies I see.
 All I have needed Thy hand hath provided; 
 Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
[V2]
 Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
 Sun, moon and stars in their courses above, 
 Join with all Nature in manifold witness
 To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[V3]
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
 Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
 Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
