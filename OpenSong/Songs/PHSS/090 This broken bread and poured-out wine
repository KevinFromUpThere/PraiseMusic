  <lyrics>[V1]
 THIS broken bread and poured-out wine 
 Sweet hallowed memories enshrine
 Of that great sacrifice divine
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V2]
 Though loomed Golgotha in His view, 
 His forethought made this statute new
 "This in remembrance of Me do;"
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V3]
 The loaf He took spake of that frame, 
 Prepared by God for Him who came 
 To manifest His Father's name
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V4]
 He gave God thanks, the loaf He brake; 
 "My body this, given for your sake," 
 Words such as these in love He spake,
 Jesus, our Lord. 
[V5]
 How solemn is the broken bread! 
 Sign of His holy body, dead,
 Who suffered in our room and stead; 
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V6]
 The cup doth memories impart
 Of His kind sympathetic heart,
 For He of blood and flesh took part; 
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V7]
 The cup of wine poured out we see; 
 This speaks of pardon full and free, 
 But tells of His deep agony
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V8]
 His woe and travail now are o'er; 
 He who sin's dreadful burden bore 
 Now lives triumphant evermore!
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V9]
 A few times more, if so it be,
 We keep His words, "Remember Me," 
 And then with joy Himself we see
 Jesus, our Lord.
