 445 GOLDEN SHORE
 WE are out on the ocean sailing;
 Homeward bound we swiftly glide. 
 We are out on the ocean sailing
 To a home beyond the tide.
 All the storms will soon be over, 
 Then we'll anchor in the harbour; 
 We are out on the ocean sailing
 To a home beyond the tide.
[V2]
 Millions now are safely landed
 Over on the golden shore;
 Many more are on their journey,
 Yet there's room for millions more.
[V3]
 Spread your sails, while heavenly breezes 
 Gently waft our vessel on;
 All on board are sweetly singing,
 Free salvation is our song.
[V4]
 When we all are safely landed,
 We shall shout, our trials o'er; 
 We shall walk about the city,
 And we'll sing for evermore.
