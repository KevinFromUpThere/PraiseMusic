<title>258 BULLINGER</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 ART thou weary, art thou languid,
 Art thou sore distressed?
 "Come to Me," saith One, "and coming, 
 Be at rest! "
[V2]
 Hath He marks to lead me to Him, 
 He who is my guide?
 In His feet and hands are wound prints,
 And His side.
[V3]
 Hath He diadem, as monarch,
 That His brow adorns? 
 Yea, a crown in very surety,
 But of thorns.
[V4]
  If my Master close I follow,
 What His guerdon here?
 Many a sorrow, many a labour,
 Many a tear.
[V5]
 If I still walk closely with Him,
 What hath He at last?
 Sorrow vanquished, labour ended, 
 Jordan passed.
[V6]
 If I ask Him to sustain me,
 Will He say me Nay?
 Not though earth and not though heaven 
 Pass away.
[V7]
 Is He sure to bless?
