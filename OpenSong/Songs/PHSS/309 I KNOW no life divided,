<lyrics>[V1]
 I KNOW no life divided,
 O Lord of life, from Thee;
  In Thee is life provided
 For all Thy saints and me.
 I know no death, Lord Jesus,
 Because I live in Thee;
 Thy death it is which frees us 
 From death eternally.
[V2]
 I fear no tribulation,
 Since whatsoe'er it be,
 It makes no separation
 Between my Lord and me.
 If Thou my God and Teacher 
 Vouchsafe to be mine own,
 Though poor I shall be richer 
 Than monarch on his throne.
[V3]
 Thy love it was which sought me
 (Thyself unsought by me),
 And to the haven brought me
 Where I would gladly be.
 The things that once distressed me
 My heart no longer move,
 Since This sweet truth impressed me, 
 That I possess Thy love.
