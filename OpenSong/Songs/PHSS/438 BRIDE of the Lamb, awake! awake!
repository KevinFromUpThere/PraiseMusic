<lyrics>[V1]
 BRIDE of the Lamb, awake! awake!
 Why sleep for sorrow now?
 The hope of glory, Christ is Thine,
 An heir of glory thou.
[V2]
 Thy spirit through the lonely night, 
 From earthly joy apart,
 Has sighed for One who's far away,
 The Bridegroom of thy heart.
[V3]
 But now the night is waning fast,
 The breaking morn is near, 
 The Bridegroom comes with voice of love
 The drooping heart to cheer.
[V4]
 He comes; for oh, His yearning heart 
 No more can bear delay;
 To scenes of full unmingled joy
 To call His Bride away.
[V5]
 This earth, the scene of all His woe,
 A homeless wild to thee,
 Full soon upon His heavenly throne
 Its rightful King shall see.
[V6]
 Thou too shalt reign; 
 He will not wear His crown of joy alone;
 And earth His royal Bride shall see
 Beside Him on the throne.
[V7]
 Then weep no more, 'tis all thine own,
 His crown, His joy divine;
 And sweeter far than all beside
 He, He Himself is thine.
