<title>47 OLD WINCHESTER</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THE head that once was crowned with Is crowned with glory now, [thorns A royal diadem adorns
 The mighty Victor's brow. 
 Delight of all who dwell above, The joy of saints below,
 To us He manifests His love That we its depths may know.
[V6]
 To us His cross with all its shame, With all its grace is given;
 Though earth disowns the lowly name, All worship it in heaven.
[V7]
 To us His cross is life and health,
 Though shame and death to Him; Our present glory, joy, and wealth,
 Our never-ending theme.
