 278 THE PATH DIVINE
 TEACH me Thy way, O Lord,
 Teach me Thy way;
 Thy gracious aid afford,
 Teach me Thy way.
 Help me to walk aright,
 More-by faith, less by sight;
 Lead me with heavenly light.
 Teach me Thy way.
[V2]
 When doubts and fears arise, 
 Teach me Thy way;
 When storms o'erspread the skies, 
 Teach me Thy way.
 Shine through the cloud and rain, 
 Through sorrow, toil and pain; 
 Make Thou my pathway plain,
 Teach me Thy way.
[V3]
 Long as my life shall last,
 Teach me Thy way;
 Where'er my lot be cast,
 Teach me Thy way. 
 Until the race is run, 
 Until the journey's done, 
 Until the crown is won,
 Teach me Thy way.
