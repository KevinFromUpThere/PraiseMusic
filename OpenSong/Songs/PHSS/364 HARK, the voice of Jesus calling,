<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, the voice of Jesus calling,
 "Who will go and work to-day?
 Fields are white and harvest waiting,
 Who will bear the sheaves away?" 
 Loud and strong the Master calleth,
 Rich reward He offers thee;
 Who will answer, gladly saying, 
 "Here am I, send me, send me?"
[V2]
 If you cannot cross the ocean
 And the heathen lands explore, 
 You can here, to needy sinners,
 Tell the gospel at your door. 
 If to waiting crowds you cannot
 Preach with eloquence the word, 
 You can give the printed message,
 Gladly scatter for the Lord. 
[V3]
 If your tongue is not like angels',
 If you cannot preach like Paul,
 You can tell the Saviour's goodness,
 You can say He died for all. 
 If you cannot rouse the wicked
 With the judgment's dread alarms, 
 You can lead the little children
 To the Saviour's waiting arms. 
[V4]
 If your place is not the watchman's,
 Standing high on Zion's wall,
 Pointing out the path to heaven,
 Offering life and peace to all,
 With your prayers and with your offerings
 You can do what God commands—
 You can be like Hur and Aaron,
 Holding up the prophet's hands.
[V5]
 If among the older people
 You may not be apt to teach,
 "Feed the lambs," said Christ the Shepherd, 
 Place the food within their reach;
 And it may be that some children
 You have led with trembling hand, 
 Will be found among your jewels
 When you reach the better land.
[V6]
 Let none hear you idly saying, 
 "There is nothing I can do,"
 While the souls of men are dying,
 And the Master calls for you.
 Take the task He gives you gladly, 
 Let His work your pleasure be;
 Answer gladly when He calleth 
 "Here am I, send me, send me."
