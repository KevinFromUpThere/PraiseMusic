<title>71 BELMONT</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 IN Christ the Lord our eyes behold
 A thousand glories more
 Than the rich gems and polished gold The sons of Aaron wore.
[V2]
 They first their own sin-offering brought To purge themselves from sin;
 His life was pure, without a spot,
 And all His nature clean. 
 Fresh blood as constant as the day Was on their altars spilt,
 But His one offering takes away For ever all our guilt.
[V4]
 Their priesthood passed through several For mortal was their race;	[hands,
 His never-changing office stands
 Eternal as His days.
[V5]
 Their range was earth, nor higher soared, The heaven of heavens is His;
 There, in His majesty, the Lord
 A Priest for ever is.
[V6]
 Eternal glories crown His name,
 As Prophet, Priest, and King;
 Soon heaven and earth shall sound His
 Each day fresh praises bring.	[fame,
