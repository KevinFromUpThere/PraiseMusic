<lyrics>[V1]
 As we survey the wondrous cross On which the Lord of glory died, Our richest gains we count but loss, And pour contempt on all our pride.
[V2]
 Forbid that we should ever boast
 Save in the cross of Christ, O God;
 All the vain things that charmed us most, We sacrifice them to His blood.
[V3]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled down; Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature ours, That were an offering far too small; Love that transcends our highest powers Demands our heart, our life, our all.
