<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, my soul, it is the Lord,
 'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word; 
 Now He speaks, and speaks to thee,
 "Ransomed sinner, lovest thou Me?
[V2]
 "I delivered thee when bound,
 And when wounded healed thy wound, 
 Sought thee wandering, set thee right, 
 Turned thy darkness into light.
[V3]
 "Can a mother's tender care
 Cease toward the child she bare? 
 Yes, she may forgetful be,
 Yet will I remember thee.
[V4]
 "Mine is an unchanging love, 
 Higher than the heights above, 
 Deeper than the depths beneath, 
 Free and faithful, strong as death.
[V5]
 "Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
 When the work of grace is done; 
 Partner of My throne shalt be—
 Ransomed sinner, lovest thou Me?"
[V6]
 Lord, it is my chief complaint 
 That my love is weak and faint, 
 Yet I love Thee and adore;
 Oh for grace to love Thee more!
