  <lyrics>[V1]
 JESUS in the heavenly temple
 Sits with God upon the throne, 
 Now no more to be forsaken,
 His humiliation gone.
[V2]
 Never more shall God the Father
 Smite the Shepherd with the sword; 
 Ne'er again shall lawless sinners
 Set at nought the glorious Lord.
[V3]
 Dwelling in eternal sunshine
 Of the countenance of God,
 Jesus fills all heaven with incense
 Of His rich atoning blood.
[V4]
 On His heart our names are graven,
 On His shoulders we are borne. 
 For His sake the Father loves us;
 Praise becomes us in return.
