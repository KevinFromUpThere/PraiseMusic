<lyrics>[V1]
 COME let us all unite to sing,
 God is love.
 Let heaven and earth their praises bring;
 God is love.
 Let every soul from sin awake, 
 Each in his heart sweet music make,
 And sing with us for Jesus' sake,
 God is love.
[V2]
 Oh, tell to earth's remotest bound,
 God is love.
 In Christ we have redemption found;
 God is love.
 His blood has put our sins away, 
 His Spirit turned our night to day, 
 And now we can rejoice to say,
 God is love.
[V3]
 How happy is our portion here!
 God is love.
 His promises our spirits cheer;
 God is love.
 He is our sun and shield by day,
 Our help, our hope, our strength and stay, 
 He will be with us all the way;
 God is love.
[V4]
 In glory we shall sing again,
 God is love.
 Yes, this shall be our lofty strain,
 God is love.
 Whilst endless ages roll along,
 In concert with the heavenly throng
 This shall be still our sweetest song,
 God is love.
