<lyrics>[V1]
 JESUS, Lover of my soul,
 Let me to Thy bosom fly, 
 While the raging billows roll, 
 While the tempest still is high. 
 Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, 
 Till the storm of life is o'er; 
 Safe into the haven guide,
 Where the tempest's heard no more.
[V2]
 Other refuge have I none,
 Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; 
 Leave, ah, leave me not alone, 
 Still support and comfort me. 
 All my trust on Thee is stayed, 
 All my help from Thee I bring;
 Cover my defenceless head
 With the shadow of Thy wing.
[V3]
 Thou, O Christ, art all I want, 
 More than all in Thee I find; 
 Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, 
 Heal the sick and lead the blind. 
 Just and holy is Thy name,
 I am all unrighteousness,
 I am full of sin and shame,
 Thou art full of truth and grace.
[V4]
 Plenteous grace with Thee is found, 
 Grace to pardon all my sin;
 Let the healing streams abound, 
 Make and keep me pure within. 
 Thou of life the fountain art, 
 Freely let me take of Thee; 
 Spring Thou up within my heart, 
 Rise to all eternity.
