<lyrics>[V1]
 FACE to face with Christ my Saviour! 
 Face to face, what will it be,
 When with rapture I behold Him, 
 Jesus Christ, who died for me?
 Face to face shall I behold Him,
 Far beyond the starry sky; 
 Face to face in all His glory
 I shall see Him by and by!
[V2]
 Only faintly now I see Him,
 With the darkening veil between;
 But a blessed day is coming 
 When His glory shall be seen.
[V3]
 What rejoicing in His presence,
 When are banished grief and pain,
 When the crooked ways are straightened
 And the dark things shall be plain!
[V4]
 Face to face! Oh, blissful moment,
 Face to face, to see and know; 
 Face to face with my Redeemer,
 Jesus Christ, who loves me so!
