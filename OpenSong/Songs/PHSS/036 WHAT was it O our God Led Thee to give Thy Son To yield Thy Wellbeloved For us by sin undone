<lyrics>[V1]
 WHAT was it, O our God, Led Thee to give Thy Son, To yield Thy Well-beloved For us by sin undone?
 'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus
 To give Thy Well-beloved for us.
[V2]
 What led the Son of God
 To leave His throne on high, To shed His precious blood, To suffer and to die?
 'Twas love, unbounded love to us, Led Him to die and suffer thus.
[V3]
 What moved Thee to impart Thy Spirit from above,
 Therewith to fill each heart
 With heavenly peace and love? 'Twas love, unbounded love to us, Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
[V4]
 What doth the Spirit move, Within us to abide,
 To teach us all Thy love,
 And tell of Him who died?
 'Tis love unbounded moves Him thus To condescend to dwell with us.
[V5]
 What love to Thee we owe, O God, for all Thy grace! Our hearts should overflow In everlasting praise.
 Help us, O God, to praise Thee thus For all Thy boundless love to us.
