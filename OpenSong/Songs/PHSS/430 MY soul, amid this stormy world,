<lyrics>[V1]
 MY soul, amid this stormy world,
 Is like some fluttered dove;
 And fain would be as swift of wing, 
 To fly to Him I love..
[V2]
 The cords that bound my heart to earth
 Were broken by His hand;
 Before His cross I now am left
 A stranger in the land.
[V3]
 That visage marred, those sorrows deep,
 The thorns, the scourge, the gall; 
 These were the golden chains of love,
 His captives to enthral.
[V4]
 My heart is with Him on the throne, 
 And ill can brook delay,
 Each moment listening for the voice,
 "Rise up and come away."
[V5]
 With hope deferred, oft sick and faint,
 "Why tarries He?" I cry,
 And should my Saviour chide my haste,
 Sure I could make reply 
[V6]
 "May not an exile, Lord, desire
 His own sweet land to see? 
 May not a captive seek release,
 A prisoner to be free?
[V7]
 "A child when far away may long
 For home and kindred dear;
 And she that waits her absent Lord
 May sigh till He appear.
[V8]
 "I would, my Lord and Saviour, know
 That which no measure knows;
 Would search the mystery of Thy love,
 The depth of all Thy woes.
[V9]
 "I fain would strike my golden harp
 Before the Father's throne;
 There cast my crown of righteousness,
 And sing what grace has done.
 "Then leave me not in this dark world, 
 A stranger long to roam;
 Come, Lord, and take me to Thyself,
 Lord Jesus, quickly come."
