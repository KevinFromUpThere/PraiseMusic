<title>247 TRANQUILLITY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus, Thou who only art
 The endless source of purest joy,
 Oh come and fill this longing heart,
 May nought but Thou my thoughts employ. 
 Teach me on Thee to fix mine eye,
 For none but Thou can satisfy.
[V2]
 The joys of earth can never fill
 The heart that's tasted of Thy love; 
 No portion would I seek until
 I reign with Thee, my Lord, above; 
 When I shall gaze upon Thy face, 
 And know more fully all Thy grace.
[V3]
 When from the radiant throne on high 
 Thou didst my fall and ruin see,
 Thou cam'st to earth for me to die
 That I might share Thy throne with Thee; 
 Loved with an everlasting love,
 My hopes, my joys are all above.
[V4]
 Oh what is all that earth can give? 
 I'm called to share in God's own joy!
  Dead to the world, in Thee I live,
 In Thee I've bliss without alloy; 
 Well may I earthly joys resign,
 All things are mine and I am Thine.
[V5]
 Till Thou shalt come to take me home, 
 Be this my one ambition, Lord,
 Self, sin, the world to overcome, 
 Fast clinging to Thy faithful word; 
 More of Thyself each day to know, 
 And more into Thine image grow.
