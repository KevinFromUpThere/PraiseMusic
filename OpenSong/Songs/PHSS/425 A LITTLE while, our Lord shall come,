<lyrics>[V1]
 A LITTLE while, our Lord shall come, 
 And we shall wander here no more; 
 He'll take us to His Father's home, 
 Where He for us has gone before; 
 To dwell with Him, to see His face, 
 And sing the glories of His grace.
[V2]
 A little while, He'll come again. 
 Let us the precious hours redeem; 
 Our only grief to give Him pain, 
 Our joy to serve and follow Him; 
 Oh, may we watch and ready be, 
 As those who long their Lord to see.
[V3]
 A little while, 'twill soon be past!
 Why should we shun the shame and cross? 
 Oh, let us in His footsteps haste,
 And count for Him all else but loss; 
 Oh, how will recompense His smile 
 The sufferings of this little while!
[V4]
 A little while! Come, Saviour, come;
 For Thee Thy Bride has tarried long. 
 Take Thy poor waiting pilgrims home, 
 To sing the new eternal song;
 To see Thy glory, and to be
 In everything conformed to Thee.
