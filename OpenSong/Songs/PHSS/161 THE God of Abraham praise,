<lyrics>[V1]
 THE God of Abraham praise, 
 Who reigns enthroned above, 
 Ancient of everlasting days,
 And God of love.
 Jehovah, great I AM,
 By earth and heaven confessed; 
 We bow, and bless the sacred name, 
 For ever blest.
[V2]
 The God of Abraham praise,
 At whose supreme command
 From earth we rise, and seek the joys
 At His right hand.
 He calls us to forsake
 Earth's wisdom, fame, and power; 
 And Him our only portion make,
 Our shield and tower.
[V3]
 The God of Abraham praise, 
 Whose all-sufficient grace
 Shall guide us all our earthly days,
 In all our ways.
 He calls a worm His friend; 
 He calls Himself our God;
 And He shall save us to the end,
 Through Jesus' blood.
[V4]
 He by Himself hath sworn,
 We on His oath depend;
 We shall on eagles' wings upborne, 
 To heaven ascend.
 We shall behold His face,
 We shall His power adore,
 And sing the wonders of His grace, 
 For evermore.
[V5]
 The whole triumphant host Give thanks to God on high;
 "Thrice holy Thou, Jehovah God,"
 They ever cry.
 We join the heavenly song;
 Our God and Abraham's praise,
 "Might, majesty to Thee belong,
 To endless days."
