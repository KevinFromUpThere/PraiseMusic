<title>398 ANGELS' STORY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I LOVE to hear the story
 Which angel voices tell,
 How once the King of glory
 Came down on earth to dwell. 
 I am both weak and sinful,
 But this I surely know,
 The Lord came down to save me, 
 Because He loves me so.
[V2]
 I'm glad the blessed Saviour
 Was once a child like me, 
 To show how pure and holy
 His little one should be. 
 And I will try to follow
 His footsteps here below; 
 For He will ne'er forget me, 
 Because He loves me so.
[V3]
 To sing His love and mercy,
 My sweetest songs I'll raise; 
 And though I cannot see Him,
 I know He hears my praise;
  For He has kindly promised
 That I shall surely go
 To sing with Him in heaven,
 Because He loves me so.
