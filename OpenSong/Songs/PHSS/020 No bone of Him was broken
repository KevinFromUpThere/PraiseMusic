  <title>20 MUNICH</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 NO bone of Him was broken
 The spotless paschal Lamb; 
 Of life and peace a token
 To us who know His name. 
 The Head for all the members
 The curse, the vengeance bore, 
 And God, our God, remembers
 His people's sins no more.
[V2]
 We, the redeemed, are reaping
 What Christ did sow in tears.
 The feast which we are keeping
 His name to us endears.
 It tells of Justice hiding
 From Him the face of God,
 Proud men around deriding
 His sorrow's awful load.
[V3]
 His death of shame and sorrow
 Was like unto His birth,
 Which would no glory borrow,
 No majesty from earth. As pilgrims we are hasting
 To our eternal home, Its joy already tasting
 Of victory o'er the tomb.
[V4]
 His life and death reviewing,
 We tread the narrow way;
 Our homeward path pursuing,
 We watch the dawn of day.
 We eat and drink with gladness
 The broken bread and wine, 
 And sing with sweetest sadness
 Our song of love divine.
