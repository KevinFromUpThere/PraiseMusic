<title>265 RECOMPENSE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 OUR Lord His glory laid aside,
 That He had known with God,
 Then came to earth as man and died
 To cleanse us by His blood.
 Good Shepherd He, stray sheep He sought, 
 Stooped low and suffered loss;
 He bore the hiding of God's face,
 A curse upon the cross.
[V2]
 He's risen now, and lives on high, 
 Again He's glorified;
 And ever liveth there to save
 His sheep for whom He died.
 As Shepherd Great, with crook in hand,
 He tends them all with care;
 E'en through death's shadow, and midst foes,
 He's present with them there.
[V3]
 Soon, as Chief Shepherd, He will come
 His loved ones home to take,
 When those who've served shall have reward, 
 Who wrought for His name's sake. 
 Crowned King of glory then He'll be,
 And Lord of Hosts beside;
 For Him the heads of lasting doors,
 And gates will open wide.
[V4]
 The Shepherd thus, Good, Great, and Chief,
 By cross, and crook, and crown, 
 Salvation threefold will have wrought
 For those He calls His own.
 Our God, we're longing for that day
 To see the Shepherd King,
 Who, with all gathered saints at home,
 Will lead the song they sing.
