<lyrics>[V1]
 310 AGAPE TOU CHRISTOU
 OURS are peace and joy divine
 Who are one with Christ,
 When, like branches in the vine,
 We abide in Christ.
 As a living, grafted shoot,
 Nourished from a hidden root, 
 We may bear all holy fruit
 Through the love of Christ.
 Love of Christ!
 Clusters grow on every branch, 
 Through the love of Christ.
[V2]
 Christian pity moves our heart
 Through the love of Christ; 
 Others' woes pierce like a dart,
 When there's love to Christ. 
 Gospel tidings we must tell, 
 Sinners warn to flee from hell, 
 Lure and win, alarm, compel,
 By the love of Christ.
 Love of Christ!
 Heaven's ranks we'll seek to swell,
 For the love of Christ.
[V3]
 We will love with tender care,
 Knowing love to Christ, 
 Brethren who His image bear,
 For the love of Christ. 
 Jesus only shall we know, 
 And our love to all shall flow
 In His blood-bought Church below,
 For the love of Christ.
 Love of Christ!
 We now love all Christ-like ones,
 For the love of Christ.
[V4]
 Now we live and walk by faith,
 Through the love of Christ; 
 We can triumph over death,
 One in life with Christ. 
 Rooted, settled, knowing more, 
 Depths and heights of love explore, 
 Till we gain the heavenly shore
 Through the love of Christ.
 Love of Christ!
 When He comes we then shall know 
 All the love of Christ.
