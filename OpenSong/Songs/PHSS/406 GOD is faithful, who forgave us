<lyrics>[V1]
 GOD is faithful, who forgave us
 All the ills we e'er had done, 
 And in pity deigned to save us
 For the sake of His dear Son. 
 God will through eternal ages
 Not one sin remember more; 
 Blotted from th'accusing pages,
 Nought the writing can restore.
[V2]
 God is faithful, He has raised us
 From the dust to glory high;
 In His Christ secure has placed us,
 Never more to fall and die.
 Bonds of love thus forged in heaven,
 Nothing, no one, can disrupt;
 Wealth of heavenly blessings given
 Rests where nothing can corrupt.
[V3]
 God is faithful, He whose word is 
 Building up in unity
 Saints who own His Christ their Lord is 
 In the one Community.
 These the Father ne'er forgetteth,
 Who the Son thus honour here;
 In His book their names He setteth,
 Gems for Him to honour there.
[V4]
 God is faithful. Deem no burden 
 He imposes hard to bear.
 Faith beholds the blessed guerdon, 
 Rest eternal waiting there.
 Ye, who for the faith contending,
 God-equipped are warring now, 
 See the faithful God extending
 Victor-wreaths to grace your brow.
[V5]
 God is faithful, He will ever
 By His promises abide.
 Human oaths may break, but never
 Fails His word whate'er betide.
  All your fears His word relieving,
 On, ye saints, your Lord to meet; 
 Gladly then, your crowns receiving,
 Haste to cast them at His feet.
