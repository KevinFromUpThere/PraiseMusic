<title>418 MONTGOMERY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 FOR ever with the Lord,
 Amen, so let it be;
 Life from the dead is in that word;
 'Tis immortality.
 Here in the body pent,
 Absent from Him we roam, 
 Yet nightly pitch our moving tent
 A day's march nearer home.
[V2]
 Our Father's house on high,
 Home of the soul how dear!
 At times, to faith's far-seeing eye,
 The golden gates appear.
 Each thirsty spirit faints
 To reach the home we love, 
 The bright inheritance of saints, 
 Jerusalem above.
[V3]
 And though there intervene
 Rough roads and stormy skies, 
 Faith will not suffer aught to screen 
 The glory from our eyes.
 There shall all clouds depart,
 The wilderness shall cease;
 And sweetly shall each gladdened heart 
 Enjoy eternal peace.
[V4]
 Knowing as we are known,
 How shall we love that word,
 How oft repeat before the throne, 
 "For ever with the Lord!" 
 Here in the body pent,
 Absent from Him we roam, 
 Yet nightly pitch our moving tent 
 A day's march nearer home.
