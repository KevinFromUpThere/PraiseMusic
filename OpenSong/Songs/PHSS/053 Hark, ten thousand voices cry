  <title>53 RESURRECTION</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, ten thousand voices cry,
 Hark, ten thousand voices cry!
 Victory! Victory! Victory!
 Through the sky.
 Swiftly flies the welcome sound, 
 Spreading rapturous joy around.
[V2]
 Jesus comes, His conflict over,
 Comes to claim His great reward; 
 Angels round the Victor hover,
 Crowding to behold their Lord.
[V3]
 Oh, what honours.now await Him!
 Friends and foes shall hear His voice; 
 Tremble, tremble, ye that hate Him.
 Ye who love His name rejoice.
[V4]
 Yonder throne for Him erected
 Now becomes the Victor's seat, 
 Lo, the Man on earth rejected,
 Angels worship at His feet!
[V5]
 Day and night they cry before Him, 
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.
 All the powers of heaven adore Him, 
 All obey His sovereign word.
[V6]
 Then haste, ye saints, your tribute bring 
 And laud the everlasting King;
 Laud Him, Laud Him, Laud Him, Laud Him
 Laud the everlasting King. 
 Laud Him, Laud the everlasting King.
