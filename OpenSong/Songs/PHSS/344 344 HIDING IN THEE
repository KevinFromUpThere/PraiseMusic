<lyrics>[V1]
 344 HIDING IN THEE
 THROUGH the dark path of sorrow
 Which Jesus has trod, 
 Thy feeble ones journey,
 O Father, our God.
 And the thick clouds that gather
 But turn us away
 From the waste, howling desert,
 Where He could not stay. 
[V2]
 From the cold world that knoweth
 And loveth its own, 
 Where Jesus was hated,
 We will cheerfully hasten,
 Rejoicing to be
 Counted worthy to suffer,
  Lord Jesus, for Thee.
[V3]
 In the fierce hour that trieth
 The children of men, 
 In the hour of temptation,
 Lord, succour us then; 
 Let the weak and the feeble
 Find under Thine arm,
  In the blast of the terri-ble,
 Shelter from storm.
[V4]
 When the proud are exalted
 And seated on high,
 When trouble and desperate 
 Sorrow are nigh,
 When the hearts of all others
 Are failing for fear,
 Then the Lord is our refuge,
 Secure we rest here.
[V5]
 We wait for His coming, 
 We long for that day;
 Bright Star of the morning,
 Thou wilt not delay;
 Let the purchased possession
 Be gathered to Thee,
 Let the groaning creation 
 From sorrow be free.
