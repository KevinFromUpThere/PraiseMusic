<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, 'tis the watchman's cry, 
 Jesus, our Lord, is nigh,
 Sleep is for sons of night,
 We are children of the light, 
 Ours is the glory bright,
[V2]
 Call to each waking band,
 Clear is our Lord's command,
 Be ye as men that wait
 Always at the Master's gate,
 E'en though the hour seem late, 
[V3]
 Heed we the Steward's call,
 There's room enough for all,
 This vineyard of the Lord
 Constant labour doth afford; 
 Ours is a sure reward,
[V4]
 Heed we the Shepherd's voice,
 Would we His heart rejoice?
 Sin calls for constant fear,
 Weakness needs the Strong One near; 
 Long as we struggle here,
[V5]
 Now sound the final chord,
 Praise, brethren, praise; Thrice holy is our Lord,
 What more befits the tongues 
 Soon to lead the angels' songs, 
 While heaven the note prolongs?
