<lyrics>[V1]
 Lo! men deem fitting to adorn
 The kingly Sufferer's brow,
 Not with gemmed gold, but wreathen thorn, 
 Then in derision bow.
 With bitter taunt they haste the King,
 Not to a glorious throne,
 But to the cross the Lord they bring, 
 And there His claims disown.
[V2]
 Now myriads own, above the skies,
 His right divine to reign,
 But still the guilty world denies 
 His title with disdain.
 Yet there's a place God set apart
 Where He may reign on earth;
 'Tis in the willing-opened heart
 Of one of heavenly birth. 
[V3]
 That heart, which He so dearly bought, 
 And cleansed by precious blood, 
 The fount of every evil thought,
 Once in rebellion stood.
 Oh, wonder! that the Lord should choose 
 This heart to be His throne,
 Can I such honour e'er refuse,
 Or spurn the grace He's shown?
[V4]
 Take, Lord, Thy rightful place within, 
 And there supremely reign,
 That never more oppressing sin 
 Dominion may obtain.
 Rule now 'midst subject hearts, O Lord, 
 That so this sterile earth
 May one green spot for Thee afford 
 In all its scene of dearth.
[V5]
 Soon shall Thy feet in triumph stand 
 Again on Olive's brow,
 When men and kings of every land
 At Thy great name shall bow. 
 Meanwhile, O Lord, Thy sceptre wield
 Among Thy loyal few,
 Till, as in heaven, all earth shall yield 
 To Thee Thy royal due.
