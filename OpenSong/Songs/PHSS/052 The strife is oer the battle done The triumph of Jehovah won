<title>52 VICTORY (WITH HALLELUJAH)</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 The strife is o'er, the battle done, The triumph of Jehovah won;
 Oh, let the song of praise be sung,
[V2]
 The powers of death have done their worst,
 Christ Jesus hath His foes dispersed;
 Let shouts of praise and joy outburst,
[V3]
 In glorious majesty to reign;
 Oh, let us swell the joyful strain,
[V5]
 When we think of love like this, Joy and shame our hearts possess; Joy that He could pity thus, Shame for such return from us.
[V6]
 Yet we soon the day shall see When we shall from sin be free, Borne aloft, to heaven brought, There to praise God as we ought.
[V4]
 He overcame the power of hell,
 The bars from heaven's high portals fell; Let songs of joy His triumph tell, Hallelujah!
[V5]
 He died upon Golgotha's tree,
 From death's dread sting to set us free, That we, O God, may sing to Thee Hallelujah! Amen.
