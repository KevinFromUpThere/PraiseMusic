<lyrics>[V1]
 THE high ways we have traversed,
 And come to Zion's hill,
 Where God, our God, is with us, 
 His purpose to fulfil.
[V2]
 Here are God's house and altar,
 The place of His great name, 
 Where praise to Him ascendeth,
 Where we His grace acclaim.
[V3]
 Can look upon His face,
 And hence a royal priesthood 
 Proclaims His matchless grace.
[V4]
 This house for God to dwell in,
 Of ransomed saints is built, 
 Who by the great atonement
 Are purged and free from guilt.
[V5]
 We come to Christ, the Chosen
 (The living stone is He),
 Through Him to God the Father, 
 To make sweet melody.
[V6]
 And forth we'd go unfearing
 The gospel to proclaim;
 The Lord Himself is with us
 As we exalt His name.
[V7]
 Earth's days will soon be over,
 The day of Christ will come; 
 Come quickly, Lord, to take us
 To Thy bright heavenly home.
