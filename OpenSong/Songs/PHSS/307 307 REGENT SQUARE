<lyrics>[V1]
 307 REGENT SQUARE
 MID the splendours of the glory
 Which we hope ere long to share,
 Christ the Head, and we the members,
 Shall appear divinely fair.
 Oh how glorious,
 When we meet Him in the air!
[V2]
 From the dateless, timeless periods
 He has loved us without cause;
 And for all the blood-bought myriads
 His is love that knows no pause.
 Matchless Lover!
 Changeless as th' eternal laws.
[V3]
 Oh what gifts shall yet be granted,
 Palms and crowns and robes of white, 
 When the hope for which we panted
 Bursts upon our gladdened sight,
 And our Saviour
 Makes us glorious through His might!
[V4]
 Bright the prospect soon to greet us
 Of that longed-for nuptial day,
 When from heaven He comes to meet us,
 On His kingly, conquering way.
 Then the Bridegroom
 And the Bride shall reign for aye.
