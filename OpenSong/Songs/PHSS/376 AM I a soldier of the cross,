<title>376 COVENANTERS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 AM I a soldier of the cross, 
 A follower of the Lamb,
 And shall I fear to own His cause,
 Or blush to speak His name?
[V2]
 Must I be carried to the skies
 On flowery beds of ease,
 While others fight to win the prize,
 And sail through stormy seas?
[V3]
 Are there no foes for me to face?
 Must I not stem the flood?
 Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
 To help me on to God?
[V4]
 Sure I must fight if I would win;
 Increase my courage, Lord!
 I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
 Supported by Thy word.
