  <lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, how wide Thy glory shines,
 How high Thy wonders rise,
 Known through the earth by thousand signs
 By thousands through the skies!
[V2]
 Those mighty orbs proclaim Thy power, 
 Their motions speak Thy skill;
 And on the wings of every hour
 We read Thy patience still.
[V3]
 But when we view Thy great design 
 To save rebellious worms,
 Our souls are filled with awe divine 
 To see what God performs.
[V4]
 For the bright glories of Christ's name
 Fill heaven and earth with praise; 
 And angels learn Immanuel's fame,
 And celebrate His grace.
[V5]
 Oh let us bear our humble part
 In that eternal song.
 Let joy and wonder tune each heart 
 And love command each tongue.
