<lyrics>[V1]
 O God, how wide Thy glory shines,
 How high Thy wonders rise, [signs, Known through the earth by thousand
 By thousands through the skies!
[V2]
 Those mighty orbs proclaim Thy power, Their motions speak Thy skill;
 And on the wings of every hour
 We read Thy patience still.
[V3]
 But when we view Thy great design To save rebellious worms,
 Our souls are filled with awe divine To see what God performs.
[V4]
 For the bright glories of Christ's name
 Fill heaven and earth with praise; And angels learn Immanuel's fame,
 And celebrate His grace.
[V5]
 Oh let us bear our humble part In that eternal song.
 Let joy and wonder tune each heart And love command each tongue.
