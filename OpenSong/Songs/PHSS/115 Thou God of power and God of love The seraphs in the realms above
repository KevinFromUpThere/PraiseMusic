<lyrics>[V1]
 Thou God of power and God of love, The seraphs in the realms above
 To Thee their praises bring,
 And veil their faces while they cry,
 "Thrice holy" to their God Most High,
 "Thrice holy" to their King.
[V2]
 Thee as our God we too would claim, And bless the precious Saviour's name
 Through whom this grace is given; Who bore the wrath to sinners due, Who formed our ruined souls anew,
 And made us heirs of heaven.
[V3]
 Give us to know the joy and love With which all worship Thee above in heaven, Thy blest abode.
 Here to our hearts Thyself reveal, And all assembled cause to feel The presence of our God.
[V2]
 Dwelling in the light intense, Holy in omnipotence,
 All Thy ways are righteousness, We with reverence would confess.
[V3]
 Thine unequalled wisdom shines Gloriously in Thy designs;
 All things working to fulfil Counsels of Thy sovereign will.
[V4]
 God of providence! Thy care, Shown by gifts Thy creatures share, Bids Thy vast creation raise
 One harmonious song of praise.
[V5]
 Father of our blessed Lord,
 Ever be Thy name adored
 For that One of matchless worth, Who so fully told Thee forth.
[V6]
 Power and wisdom, wondrously Joined with love and righteousness,
 Us eternally to bless.
[V7]
 For the life He lived below,
 For the cross with all its woe,
 For His glorious victory,
 We would praise and worship Thee.
