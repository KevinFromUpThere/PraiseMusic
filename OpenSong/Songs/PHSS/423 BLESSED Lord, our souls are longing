<lyrics>[V1]
 BLESSED Lord, our souls are longing
 Thee, our risen Head, to see;
 And the cloudless morn is dawning 
 Thy saints shall gathered be. 
 Grace and glory!
 All our well-springs are in Thee.
[V2]
 All the sorrow we are tasting, 
 Is but as the dream of night;
 To the day of Christ we're hasting, 
 Looking for it with delight.
 Thou art coming; 
 This will satisfy our sight.
[V3]
 True, the silent grave is keeping
 Many a seed in weakness sown,
 But the saints in Thee now sleeping,
 Raised in power shall share Thy throne.
 Lord of glory, 'tis Thine own.
[V4]
 As we sing, our hearts grow lighter, 
 We are children of the day;
 Sorrow makes our hope the brighter,
 Faith regards not the delay.
 Sure the promise,
 We shall meet Thee on the way.
