<lyrics>[V1]
 GAZING On the Lord in glory While our hearts in worship bow, There we read the wondrous story Of the cross, its shame and woe.
[V2]
 Every mark of dark dishonour Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow, All the depths of His heart's sorrow Told in answering glory now.
[V3]
 On that cross alone, forsaken,
 Where no pitying eye was found; Now to God's right hand exaltedï¿½With His praise the heavens resound.
[V4]
 Did His God e'en then forsake Him, Hide Himself from His deep need?
 In that face, once marred and smitten, All His glory now we read.
[V5]
 Rise, our hearts, and bless the Father; Ceaseless song e'en here begunï¿½Endless praise and adoration
 To the Father and the Son. Amen.
