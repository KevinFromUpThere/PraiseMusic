 424 ME TA RASSESTHO
 "LET not your heart be troubled, 
 Nor let it be afraid;
 Believe in God, My Father, 
 Believe what I have said.
 My Father's house hath many 
 A mansion bright and fair; 
 And I am going yonder
 A place now to prepare.
[V2]
 Where you shall ever be;
 I'll come again and take you
 To dwell for aye with Me.
  I'm going to the Father
 Who will send you a Guide, 
 The blessed holy Paraclete, 
 Within you to abide."
[V3]
 We look, then, for His coming. 
 We who alive remain,
 And they who sleep, together
 Shall see the Lamb once slain. 
 They raised in incorruption,
 And we from death set free, 
 Shall all be like the Master,
 Oh mighty mystery!
[V4]
 We wait for Christ, the Saviour, 
 To come from heaven above, 
 To fashion us in glory,
 And teach us all His love.
 He says, "I'm coming quickly," 
 We cry with one accord
 To Christ, our great Redeemer, 
 "Come quickly, blessed Lord."
