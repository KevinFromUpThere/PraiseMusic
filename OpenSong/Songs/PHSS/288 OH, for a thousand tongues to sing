<lyrics>[V1]
 OH, for a thousand tongues to sing
 The great Redeemer's praise,
 The glories of our God and King,
 The triumphs of His grace!
[V2]
 That bids our sorrows cease;
 'Tis music in our ransomed ears,
 'Tis life and health and peace.
[V3]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
 He sets the prisoners free;
 His blood can make the foulest clean; 
 His blood availed for me.
[V4]
 He speaks, and, listening to His voice, 
 New life the dead receive;
 The mourning, weary souls rejoice,
 The child-like hearts believe.
[V5]
 And soon for us He'll gladly come 
 To take us hence away;
 We'll sing His praise in yon bright home 
 Throughout an endless day.
