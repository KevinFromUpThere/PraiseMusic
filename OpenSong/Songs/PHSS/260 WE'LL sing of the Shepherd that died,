<title>260 CELESTE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WE'LL sing of the Shepherd that died, 
 That died for the sake of the flock; 
 His love to the utmost was tried,
 But firmly endured as a rock.
[V2]
 When blood from a victim must flow
 This Shepherd, by pity, was led
 To stand in our place and to know
 The suffering and death in our stead.
[V3]
 Our song, then, for ever shall be
 Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus; 
 No subject's so glorious as He,
 Nor theme so affecting to us.
[V4]
 We'd sing of such subjects alone,
 None other our tongues should employ, 
 Till better His love becomes known
 In yonder bright regions of joy.
