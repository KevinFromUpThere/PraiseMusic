  <title>092 We Never Would Forget His Love</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE never would forget His love, 
 Who has redeemed us by His blood, 
 And now as our High Priest above 
 Lives as our Advocate with God.
[V2]
 We never would forget the pain,
 The blood-like sweat, the shameful tree,
 The wrath His soul did once sustain, 
 From sin and death to set us free.
[V3]
 In broken bread and out-poured wine 
 We hear Him say, " Remember Me;
 I gave My life, a price divine,
 I bore the wrath to set you free."
[V4]
 O God, we gladly praise His love, 
 Who suffered for us on the tree;
 And till He come from heaven above 
 We keep His word " Remember Me."</lyrics>
