  <title>326 I KNOW NOT WHY</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I KNOW not why God's wondrous grace 
 To me hath been made known,
 Or why, unworthy as I am,
 He claimed me for His own.
[c]
 But "I know whom I have believed, 
 And am persuaded that He is able 
 To keep that which I've committed
 Unto Him against that day."
[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith 
 To me He did impart;
 Or how believing in His word 
 Wrought peace within my heart.
[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves, 
 Convincing men of sin,
 Revealing Jesus through the word, 
 Creating faith in Him.
[V4]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me,
 Of weary ways or golden days,
 Before His face I see. 
[V5]
 I know not when my Lord may come;
 I know not how, nor where;
 If I shall pass the vale of death
 Or meet Him in the air.
