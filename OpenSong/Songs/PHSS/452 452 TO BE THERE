<lyrics>[V1]
 452 TO BE THERE
 WE sing of the realms of the blest, 
 That country so bright and so fair, 
 And oft are its glories confessed; 
 But what must it be to be there!
[V2]
 We speak of its freedom from sin, 
 From sorrow, temptation and care, 
 From trials without and within; 
 But what must it be to be there!
[V3]
 We speak of its service of love,
 Of the robes which the glorified wear, 
 The church of the first-born above; 
 But what must it be to be there!
[V4]
 Do Thou, Lord, midst pleasure and woe, 
 Still for heaven our spirits prepare;
 And shortly we also shall know,
 And feel, what it is to be there.
