  <title>062 Head of the Church Triumphant</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Head of the Church triumphant,
 Now seated in the glory!
 Head of the Church triumphant,
 Now seated in the glory!
 Till He appear
 His members here,
 O God, would bow, O God, would bow
 O God, would bow before Thee. 
[V1b]
 Head of the Church triumphant!
 We lift our hearts and voices
 In blest anticipation,
 And cry aloud and sing to God
 The praise of our salvation (x3)
 And cry aloud, and give to God,
 The praise of our salvation.

[V2]
 By faith we see the glory
 Of which Thou dost assure us,
 By faith we see the glory
 Of which Thou dost assure us,
 The world despise
 For that high prize
 Which Thou has set, Which Thou has set,
 Which Thou hast set before us.

[V2b]
 We wait with expectation
 The happy consummation
 Of His blest promise given,
 To meet our Lord
 By all adored,
 And swell the praise of heaven, (x3)
 To meet our Lord, by all adored
 And swell the praise of heaven.</lyrics>
