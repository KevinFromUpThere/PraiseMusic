  <title>095 Oh Blessed God The Father</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 O BLESSED God, the Father
 Of Jesus Christ our Lord, In Him we are before Thee,
 According to Thy word;
 A kingdom He has made us,
 Priests unto Thee Most High, And we (as Thou hast bade us)
 As worshippers draw nigh.
[V2]
 We meditate in wonder,
 O God, upon Thy love;
 Thy matchless grace we ponder
 That sent Christ from above; We think with joy, yet sadness,
 Of how He stooped to die,
 And praise Thy name with gladness
 He's seated now on high.
[V3]
 We praise Thee for the savour
 Of His most blessed name,
 Who brought such glory to Thee,
 Who did Thy love proclaim; He was for Thee an offering
 Devoted to Thy will;
 He gave Thee boundless pleasure, He Thee delighteth still.
