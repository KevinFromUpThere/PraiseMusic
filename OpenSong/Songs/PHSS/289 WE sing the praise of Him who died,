<lyrics>[V1]
 WE sing the praise of Him who died, 
 Of Him who died upon the cross—
 The sinner's hope. Though men deride,
  For this we count the world but loss.
[V2]
 Inscribed upon the cross we see 
 In shining letters, "God is Love."
 The Lamb who died upon the tree 
 Has brought us mercy from above.
[V3]
 The cross! it takes our guilt away,
  It holds the fainting spirit up;
 It cheers with hope the gloomy day, 
 And sweetens every bitter cup.
[V4]
 It makes the coward spirit brave, 
 And nerves the feeble arm for fight; 
 It takes its terrors from the grave,
  And gilds the bed of death with light.
[V5]
 The balm of life, the cure of woe, 
 The measure and the pledge of love, 
 The sinner's refuge here below,
 The angel's theme in heaven above.
