<lyrics>[V1]
 OH come, Thou stricken Lamb of God, 
 Who shedd'st for us Thine own life-blood, 
 And teach us all Thy love; then pain 
 Were sweet, and life or death were gain.
[V2]
 Take Thou our hearts, and let them be
 For ever closed to all but Thee;
 Thy willing servants, let us wear
 The seal of love for ever there.
[V3]
 How blest are they who still abide 
 Close sheltered by Thy watchful side,
 Who life and strength from Thee receive, 
 And with Thee move, and in Thee live!
[V4]
 How can it be, Thou heavenly King, 
 That Thou shouldst man to glory bring, 
 Make slaves the partners of Thy throne, 
 Decked with a never-fading crown ?
[V5]
 O Lord, enlarge our scanty thought
 To know the wonders Thou hast wrought ; 
 Unloose our stammering tongues to tell 
 Thy love immense, unsearchable.
[V6]
 First-born of many brethren Thou, 
 To whom both heaven and earth must bow!
 Heirs of Thy shame and of Thy throne, 
 We bear the cross and seek the crown.
