<lyrics>[V1]
 S [AND up and bless the Lord,
 Ye people of His choice:
 Stand up and bless the Lord your God With heart and soul and voice.
[V2]
 Though high above all praise, Above all blessing high,
 Who would not fear His holy name, And laud and magnify?
[V3]
 Oh, for the living flame
 From His own altar brought,
 To touch our lips, our mind inspire, And wing to heaven our thought!
[V4]
 God is our strength and song,
 And His salvation ours;
 Then be His love in Christ proclaimed, With all our ransomed powers.
[V5]
 Stand up and bless the Lord,
 The Lord your God adore;
 Stand up and bless His glorious name Henceforth for evermore.
