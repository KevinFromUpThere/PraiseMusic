<title>348 WHITHER, PILGRIMS?</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WHITHER, pilgrims, are you going,
 Going each with staff in hand? 
 We are going on a journey,
 Going at our Lord's command. 
 Over hills and plains and valleys 
 We are going to His palace,
 Going to the better land.
[V2]
 Tell us, pilgrims, what you hope for 
 In that far-off better land?
 Spotless robes and crowns of glory 
 From the Saviour's loving hand.
 We shall drink of life's clear river,
 We shall dwell with God for ever,
 In that bright and better land.
[V3]
 Fear ye not the way so lonely,
 Ye a feeble little band?
 No, for friends unseen are near us,
 Angels bright around us stand;
 Christ, our Leader, walks beside us,
 He will guard and He will guide us,
 Going to the better land.
