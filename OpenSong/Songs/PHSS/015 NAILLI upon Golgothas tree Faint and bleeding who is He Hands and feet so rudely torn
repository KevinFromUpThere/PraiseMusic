<lyrics>[V1]
 NAILLI) upon Golgotha's tree, Faint and bleeding, who is He? Hands and feet so rudely torn,
 Wreathed with crown of twisted thorn. Once He lived in heaven above, Happy in His Father's love;
 Son of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
[V2]
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, Mocked and taunted, who is He? Scorners tell Him to come down, Claim His kingdom and His crown. He it was who came to bless,
 Full of love and tenderness; Son of Man, 'Os He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
[V3]
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, As a Victim, who is He? Bearing sin, but not His own, Suffering agony unknown. He, the promised sacrifice,
 For the sinner bleeds and dies; Lamb of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
 16	SIELL A
 O LovE divine, what hast thou done! The Christ of God for us hath bled; The Father's co-eternal Son
 Had all our sins upon Him laid. The Son of God for us hath died, Our Lord, our Life was crucified.
[V2]
 Was crucified for us in shame
 To bring us rebels back to God. So may we glory in His name,
 As those redeemed by precious blood. Pardon and fife flowed from His side, When He our Lord was crucified.
 Then let us glory in the cross, [theme; Make Christ our boast, our constant All things for Him account but loss, And now for Him despise the shame. Let nought with Him our hearts divide Since He for us was crucified.
