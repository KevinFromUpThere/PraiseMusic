<lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD of Bethel, by whose hand 
 Thy people still are fed,
 Who through this weary pilgrimage 
 Hast all our fathers led;
[V2]
 Our prayers, our praise, we now present 
 Before the throne of grace;
 God of our fathers, be the God
 Of each succeeding race.
[V3]
 Through each perplexing path of life
 Our wandering footsteps guide; 
 Give us each day our daily bread,
 And raiment fit provide.
[V4]
 Oh, spread Thy covering wings around 
 Till all our wanderings cease,
 And at our Father's loved abode
 Our souls arrive in peace.
[V5]
 Such blessings from Thy gracious hand 
 Our humble prayers implore,
 And Thou shalt be our chosen God 
 And portion evermore.
