<lyrics>[V1]
 CHRIST has done the mighty work; Nothing left for us to do
 But to enter on His toil,
 Enter on His triumph too.
[V2]
 His the pardon, ours the sinï¿½Great the sin, the pardon great; His the good, and ours the ill; His the love, and ours the hate.
[V3]
 His the labour, ours the rest; His the death, and ours the life; Ours the fruits of victory,
 His the agony and strife.
[V4]
 He has sown the precious seed, Nothing left for us unsown; Ours it is to reap the field, Make the harvest joy our own.
