<lyrics>[V1]
 O God of matchless grace
 We sing unto Thy name; We stand accepted in the place
 That none but Christ could claim. Our willing hearts have heard Thy voice, And in Thy mercy we rejoice.
[V2]
 'Tis meet that Thy delight
 Should centre in Thy Son;
 That Thou shouldst place us in Thy
 In Him Thy Holy One.	[sight,
 Thy perfect love hath cast out fear,
 Thy favour shines upon us here.
[V3]
 Eternal is our rest
 In Him who pleased Thee;
 Now of His peace, His joy, possessed, We wait His face to see.
 Now to Thy heart, O God, received, We know Thee whom we have believed.
