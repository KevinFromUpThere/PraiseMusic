<lyrics>[V1]
 COME, ye saints, rejoice with Jesus,
 Called with Him His joy to share; 
 Seraphs worship, angels praise Him,
 We His friends and followers are.
 Lost ones found and
 Dead ones raised
 Now the heart of Jesus cheer.
[V2]
 Praise the Lord, sing Hallelujah!
 Endless praises let us bring;
 Praise His name for these great mercies; 
 Turn we now His praise to sing. 
 Loudest praises
 Make the court of heaven ring.
[V3]
 Praise Him, praise Him, never ceasing,
 Ye who prove God's boundless grace; 
 Have we asked and has He answered?
 Thankful hearts to heaven raise.
 He is worthy
 To receive His people's praise.
[V4]
 Heartfelt praise to God we give;
 They should loudest sing His praises,
 Who His blessings thus receive.
 Songs of praises
 Let us render while we live.
[V5]
 Shout, ye ransomed heirs of heaven,
 Saved to show God's praises forth; 
 While ye shout let joys unspoken
 Fill your hearts with heavenly mirth;
 Hearts exulting,
 Songs outbursting,
 Put to shame the joys of earth.
