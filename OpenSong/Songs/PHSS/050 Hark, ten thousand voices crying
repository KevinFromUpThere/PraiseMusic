  <title>50 STUTTGART</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, ten thousand voices crying,
 "Lamb of God," with one accord! 
 Thousand, thousand saints replying
 Wake at once the echoing chord.
[V2]
 Praise the Lamb! the chorus waking,
 All in heaven together throng; 
 Loud and far, each tongue partaking,
 Rolls along the endless song.
[V3]
 Grateful incense this ascending
 Ever to the Father's throne; 
 Every knee to Jesus bending,
 All the mind of heaven is one.
[V4]
 All the Father's counsels claiming
 Equal honours to the Son;
 All the Son's effulgence beaming 
 Makes the Father's glory known.
[V5]
 By the Spirit all pervading,
 Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb 
 Crowd with light and joy unfading, 
 Hail Him as the great I AM.
[V6]
 Joyful now the wide creation
 Rests in undisturbed repose, 
 Blest in Jesus' full salvation
 Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.
[V7]
 Hark! the heavenly notes of praises
 Loudly swells the song again;
 Joy responsive "Amen!" raises, 
 Hallelujah, and Amen!
