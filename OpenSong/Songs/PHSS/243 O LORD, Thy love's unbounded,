<title>243 SALVATORI</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, Thy love's unbounded,
 So sweet, so full, so free; 
 My soul is all transported
 Whene'er I think of Thee.
 Yet, Lord, alas! what weakness
 Within myself I find;
 No infant's changing pleasure 
 Is like my wandering mind.
[V2]
 And yet Thy love's unchanging,
 And doth recall my heart 
 To joy in all its brightness,
 The peace its beams impart. 
 Yet, sure, if in Thy presence
 My soul still constant were,
 Mine eye would, more familiar,
 Its brighter glories bear.
[V3]
 And thus Thy deep perfections
 Much better should I know, 
 And with adoring fervour
 In this Thy nature grow. 
 Still sweet 'tis to discover,
 If clouds have dimmed my sight, 
 When passed, eternal Lover,
 As ever, Thou art bright.
[V4]
 Oh, keep my soul, Lord Jesus,
 Abiding still with Thee;
 And if I wander, teach me
 Soon back to Thee to flee. 
 That all Thy gracious favour 
 May to my soul be known; 
 And versed in this Thy goodness, 
 My hopes Thyself shalt crown.
