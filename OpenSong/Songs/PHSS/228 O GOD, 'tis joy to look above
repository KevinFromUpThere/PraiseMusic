<lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, 'tis joy to look above 
 And see Christ on Thy throne;
 To search the heights and depths of love 
 Which He to us has shown;
[V2]
 To look beyond the long dark night 
 And hail the coming day,
 When He to all the saints in light 
 His glories will display.
[V3]
 And oh, 'tis joy the path to trace 
 By Him so meekly trod;
 Learning of Him to walk in grace, 
 In fellowship with God.
[V4]
 Joy to confess His blessed name.
 The virtues of His blood;
 And to the weary heart proclaim,
 "Behold the Lamb of God."
