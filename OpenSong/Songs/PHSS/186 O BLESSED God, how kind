<lyrics>[V1]
 O BLESSED God, how kind
 Are all Thy ways to me,
 Whose dark, benighted mind
 Was enmity to Thee!
 Yet now, subdued by sovereign grace, 
 My spirit longs for Thine embrace.
[V2]
 How precious are Thy thoughts
 That o'er my spirit roll!
 They swell beyond my faults
 And captivate my soul.
 How great their sum, how high they rise, 
 Can ne'er be known beneath the skies.
[V3]
 Preserved by Jesus, when
 My feet made haste to hell, 
 And there should I have gone, 
 But Thou doest all things well.
 Thy love was great, Thy mercy free,
 Which from the pit delivered me.
[V4]
 Before Thy hands had made
 The sun to rule the day,
 Or earth's foundation laid,
 Or fashioned Adam's clay,
 What thoughts of peace and mercy flowed 
 In Thy great heart of love, O God!
[V5]
 A monument of grace,
 A sinner saved by blood,
 The streams of love I trace 
 Up to the fountain, God;
 And in His sovereign counsels see 
 Eternal thoughts of love to me.
