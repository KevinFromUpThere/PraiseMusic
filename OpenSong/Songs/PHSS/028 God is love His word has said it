  <title>28 GOD IS LOVE</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 God is love, His word has said it,
 This is news of heavenly birth; 
 In our hearts His Spirit shed it,
 Made us know it here on earth,
 That God is love. 
 
[V1]
 Not in yonder blessed regions
 Where the Lord, in glory crowned, 
 Reigns amid angelic legions,
 Will the brightest proof be found 
 That God is love.
[V3]
 'Tis on earth the Lord discloses
 All His love how vast it is;
 Earth's the favoured spot He chooses
 To display the truth of this-
 That God is love.
[V4]
 'Tis that Man of Sorrows yonder,
 Object of contempt beneath,
 But in heaven of highest wonder,
 Teaches fully by His death
 That God is love.
[V5]
 His a throne, the throne of heaven,
 Yet He comes to earth to bleed, 
 And for man His life is given.
 This is what declares indeed
 That God is love.
[V6]
 Not for those who ever loved Him 
 Did the Lord of glory die;
 Pity to the wretched moved Him, 
 Who that hears it will deny 
 That God is love?
[V7]
 Let us lowly now adore Him,
 Triune God of love and grace;
 Joyful bow the knee before Him,
 Laud His goodness, sound His praise, 
 For God is love.
