<title>28 GOD IS LOVE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 God is love, His word has said it,
 This is news of heavenly birth; In our hearts His Spirit shed it,
 Made us know it here on earth,
 That God is love. 
 Not in yonder blessed regions
 Where the Lord, in glory crowned, Reigns amid angelic legions,
 Will the brightest proof be found That God is love.
[V6]
 'Tis on earth the Lord discloses
 All His love how vast it is;
 Earth's the favoured spot He chooses
 To display the truth of thisï¿½
 That God is love.
[V7]
 'Tis that Man of Sorrows yonder,
 Object of contempt beneath,
 But in heaven of highest wonder,
 Teaches fully by His death
 That God is love.
[V8]
 His a throne, the throne of heaven,
 Yet He comes to earth to bleed, And for man His life is given.
 This is what declares indeed
 That God is love.
[V9]
 Not for those who ever loved Him Did the Lord of glory die;
 Pity to the wretched moved Him, Who that hears it will deny That God is love?
 Let us lowly now adore Him,
 Triune God of love and grace;
 Joyful bow the knee before Him,
 Laud His goodness, sound His praise, For God is love.
