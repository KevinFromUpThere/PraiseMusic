<lyrics>[V1]
 THE happy morn is come; 
 Triumphant o'er the grave 
 The Saviour leaves the tomb, 
 Almighty now to save. 
 Captivity is captive led,
 Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
[V2]
 Who now accuseth them
 For whom the Surety died? Or who shall those condemn Whom God hath justified? Captivity is captive led,
 Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
[V3]
 Christ hath the ransom paid, The glorious work is done; On Him our help was laid, The victory is won.
 Captivity is captive led,
 Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
[V4]
 To the triumphant Lord
 (The Resurrection He),
 To the incarnate Word
 Eternal honours be.
 Captivity is captive led,
 Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
