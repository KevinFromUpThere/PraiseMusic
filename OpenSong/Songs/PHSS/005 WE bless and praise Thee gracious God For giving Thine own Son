<title>5 BLESSED NAME</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 WE bless and praise Thee, gracious God, For giving Thine own Son,
 Who did partake of flesh and blood, In all our sorrows one.
 Well may we wonder at the thought
 That Christ came down so low,
 That He so near to us was brought To understand our woe.
[V2]
 He, mingling with the human race,
 Saw sin, death, Satan's power; Before His holy piercing gaze
 The very demons cower.
 But not alone in living strife
 He fought the triple foe; Upon the cross He gave His life;
 By dying laid them low.
[V3]
 For us He died upon the tree,
 For us was shed His blood,
 But more than that since unto Thee
 He gave Himself, O God.
 Christ, spotless, offered Thee Himself,
 Oh, what a gift divine!
 Its fragrant worth no tongue can tell,
 What joy, O God, was Thine!
[V4]
 In the eternal Spirit He
 Offered Himself to God; And in the Holy Spirit we
 Now sing a grateful ode.
 For now He lives, we praise Thy name,
 He lives no more to die;
 'Tis ours to celebrate His fame,
 Who sits with Thee on high.
[V5]
 Before Thy face we own His grace, He once for us was poor.
 We bless His name, we sing His fame, He liveth evermore.
 Our hymn of praise with joy we raise, His worth no tongue can tell.
 So great His love all praise above,
 He hath done all things well.
