<lyrics>[V1]
 O CHILD of God, there is for thee
 One only safe retreat—
 Where Jesus is thy heart should be,
 Thy dwelling at His feet.
[V2]
 When Satan tracks thy lonely way,
 There his temptations meet;
 In Jesus' presence watch and pray,
 Yea, conquer at His feet.
[V3]
 Since thou hast much to learn, although
 Thou art in Christ complete,
 In grace and knowledge seek to grow, 
 By sitting at His feet.
[V4]
 Through tribulation hasten on,
 With Christ the cross is sweet; 
 The little while will soon be gone;
 Keep only at His feet.
[V5]
 O child of God, forget the past,
 Prepare thy Lord to greet,
 That thou may'st share His throne, and cast,
 Thy crown before His feet.
