<lyrics>[V1]
 226 SILVER HILL
 BEFORE the throne of God above
 I have a strong, a perfect plea—
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love, 
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.
[V2]
 My name is graven on His hands; 
 My name is written on His heart;
 I know that while in heaven He stands, 
 No tongue can bid me hence depart.
[V3]
 When Satan tempts me to despair 
 And tells me of the guilt within, 
 Upward I look and see Him there 
 Who made an end of all my sin.
[V4]
 Because the sinless Saviour died
 My sinful soul is counted free, 
 For God, the Just, is satisfied 
 To look on Him and pardon me.
[V5]
 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb, 
 My perfect, spotless righteousness; 
 The great unchangeable I AM, 
 The King of glory and of grace.
[V6]
 One with Himself, I cannot die;
 My soul is purchased with His blood; 
 My life is hid with Christ on high, 
 With Christ my Saviour, and my God.
