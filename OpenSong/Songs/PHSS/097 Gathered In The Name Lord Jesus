  <title>097 Gathered In The Name Lord Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 GATHERED in the name Lord Jesus, 
 Breaking bread at His command, 
 Looking at the mystic tokens
 We behold and understand
 How for us He left the glory
 As a Man 'mongst men to dwell, 
 Gave His life-blood, wondrous story, 
 Thus to rescue us from hell.
[V2]
 Now with holy boldness bringing
 Firstfruits of our lies to God, 
 Fruit of lips we join in singing
 Jesus' praise with one accord. 
 Many hearts as one united,
 Many voices blend in one,
 As we raise our loud hosannas,
 Praises to our God alone.
[V3]
 Jesus' death and resurrection
 Is the theme that fills our heart; 
 On the cross for our redemption
 He was pierced with judgment's dart. 
 For us stricken, smitten, bruised,
 For us bearing sin's vast load; 
 All the wrath of God endured,
 Paid our debt with His life's blood.
[V4]
 In the silent grave they lay Him,
 Seal the stone and guard it well. 
 Sheol's fetters cannot hold Him,
 Powerless all the hosts of hell.
 He comes forth o'er death victorious,
 See Him now the risen One,
 Prince of life and King of glory,
 Raised to heaven's eternal throne.
[V5]
 Prophet, Priest and King, behold Him,
 Saviour, Shepherd, Christ and Lord; 
 Heaven's myriads bow before Him,
 Praise His name with one accord. 
 Saints on earth their voices raising
 Shout the praises, bless the name 
 Of the One who died to save us,
 Jesus evermore the same.
