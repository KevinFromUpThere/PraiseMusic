<lyrics>[V1]
 GOD of my life, to Thee I call; 
 Afflicted, at Thy feet I fall.
 When the great waterfloods prevail, 
 Leave not my trembling heart to fail.
[V2]
 Friend of the friendless and the faint, 
 Where should I lodge my deep complaint, 
 Where, but with Thee, whose open door 
 Invites the helpless and the poor?
[V3]
 Did ever mourner plead with Thee, 
 And Thou refuse that mourner's plea? 
 Does not the word still fixed remain, 
 That none shall seek Thy face in vain?
[V4]
 That were a grief I could not bear, 
 Didst Thou not hear and answer prayer. 
 But a prayer-hearing, answering God 
 Supports me under every load.
[V5]
 Fair is the lot that's cast for me;
 I have an Advocate with Thee. 
 They whom the world caresses most 
 Have no such privilege to boast.
[V6]
 Poor though I am, despised, forgot, 
 Yet God, my God, forgets me not; 
 And he is safe, and must succeed,
 For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.
