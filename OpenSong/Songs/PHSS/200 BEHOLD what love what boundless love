  <title>200 BEHOLD, WHAT LOVE</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BEHOLD what love, what boundless love, 
 The Father hath bestowed
 On sinners lost, that we should be
 Now called the sons of God!
[c]
 Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
 That we should be called the sons of God!
[V2]
 No longer far from Him but now
 By precious blood made nigh,
 Accepted in the Well-beloved, 
 Near to God's heart we lie.
[V3]
 What we in glory soon shall be,
 It doth not yet appear;
 But when our blessed Lord we see, 
 We shall His image bear.
[V4]
 With such a bless√®d hope in view, 
 We would more holy be,
 More like our risen, glorious Lord
 Whose face we shall soon see.
