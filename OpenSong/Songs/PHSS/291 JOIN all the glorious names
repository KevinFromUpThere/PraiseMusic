<lyrics>[V1]
 JOIN all the glorious names
 Of wisdom, love and power, 
 That mortals ever knew,
 That angels ever bore;
 All are too mean to speak His worth, 
 Too mean to set our Saviour forth.
[V2]
 Great Prophet of our God,
 Our tongue would bless Thy name; 
 By Thee the joyful news
 Of our salvation came;
 The joyful news of sins forgiven,
 Of hell subdued, of peace with heaven.
[V3]
 Be Thou our Counsellor, 
 Our pattern and our Guide; 
 And through this desert land 
 Still keep us near Thy side;
 Oh, let our feet ne'er run astray,
 Nor rove, nor seek the crooked way,
[V4]
 We love our Shepherd's voice; 
 His watchful eye shall keep
 Our wandering souls among
 The thousands of His sheep;
 He feeds His flock, He calls their names, 
 His bosom bears the tender lambs.
[V5]
 Should all the hosts of death 
 And powers of hell unknown, 
 Put their most dreadful forms 
 Of rage and mischief on,
 We shall be safe; for Christ displays
 Almighty power and guardian grace.
