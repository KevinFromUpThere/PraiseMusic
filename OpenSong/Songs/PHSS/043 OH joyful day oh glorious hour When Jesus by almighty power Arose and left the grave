<lyrics>[V1]
 OH joyful day, oh glorious hour, When Jesus by almighty power Arose and left the grave!
 In all His works behold Him great, Before, almighty to create,
 Almighty now to save.
[V2]
 The First-begotten from the dead, He's risen now, His people's Head, And thus their life's secure.
 And if like Him they yield their breath, Like Him they'll burst the bonds of Their resurrection sure.	[death,
[V3]
 Why should His people then be sad? None have such reason to be glad
 As those redeemed to God. Jesus the mighty Saviour lives, To them eternal life He gives,
 The purchase of His blood.
[V4]
 Then let our gladsome praise resound, And let us in His work abound, Whose blessed name is Love.
 We're sure our labour's not in vain, For we with Him ere long shall reign, With Jesus dwell above.
