<lyrics>[V1]
 PRAISE the Lord who died to save us,
 Praise His ever gracious name;
 Praise Him that He lives to bless us,
 Now and evermore the same;
 Praise the Saviour!
 We would all His love proclaim.
[V2]
 Grace it was, yea, grace abounding,
 Brought Him down to save the lost. 
 Ye above, the throne surrounding,
 Praise Him, praise Him, all His host.
 Saints adore Him;
 We are they who owe Him most.
[V3]
 We of all His hand created
 Objects of such grace alone,
 By eternal love elected,
 Destined now to share His throne, 
 Sing with wonder,
 Sing of what the Lord has done!
[V4]
 Praise His name who died to save us; 
 'Tis by Him His people live,
 And in Him the Father gave us
 All that boundless love could give; 
 Life eternal
 In our Saviour we receive.
