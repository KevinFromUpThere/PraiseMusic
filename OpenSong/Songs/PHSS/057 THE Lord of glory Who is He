<title>57 LUTHER'S HYMN</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lord of glory! Who is He?
 Who is the King of glory? Only the Son of God can be
 The Christ, the King of glory. Consider all His wounds, and see How Jesus' death upon the tree
 Proclaims Him King of glory.
[V2]
 Above all heavens at God's right hand
 Now sits the King of glory.
 The angels by His favour stand
 Before the throne of glory;
 Swiftly they fly at His command
 To guard His own of every land,
 To keep the heirs of glory.
[V3]
 Death and the grave confess the Lamb To be the King of glory;
 The powers of darkness dread His name, Creation shows His glory.
 He said, " Ere Abra'am was I am,' Jesus is evermore the same
 Th' Almighty King of glory.
[V4]
 Thrice happy who in Him believe,
 They soon shall share His glory; Born of His Spirit, they receive
 His secret pledge of glory.
 Taught by His cross. for sin they grieve; He calls them brethren, and they cleave
 To Him, their hope of glory.
