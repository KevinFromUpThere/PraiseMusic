<lyrics>[V1]
 TAKE my life, and let it be 
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
 Take my moments and my days, 
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise; 
 Take my hands, and let them move 
 At the impulse of Thy love;
 Take my feet, and let them be 
 Swift and beautiful for Thee.
[V2]
 Take my voice, and let me sing
 Always, only for the King; 
 Take my lips, and let them be
  Filled with messages from Thee; 
 Take my silver and my gold, 
 Not a mite would I withhold; 
 Take my intellect, and use
 Every power as Thou shalt choose.
[V3]
 Take my will, and make it Thine, 
 Let it be no longer mine;
 Take my heart—it is Thine own, 
 Let it be Thy royal throne;
 Take my love, Lord, I would pour 
 At Thy feet its treasure-store; 
 Take myself, and let me be
 Ever, only, all for Thee.
