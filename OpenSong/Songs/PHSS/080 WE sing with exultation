  <lyrics>[V1]
 WE sing with exultation
 To Thee, eternal God,
 Of Him who's Thy salvation,
 Of Jesus Christ our Lord.
 'Twas He who once descended
 More marred than men to be, 
 Than men whom He befriended,
 Who pierced Him on the tree.
[V2]
 Through Him Thy love's commended
 And justice satisfied;
 To Thee He hath ascended
 Whom He hath glorified;
 And now Thy love unbounded
 Is flowing full and free,
 And Him Thou hast surrounded
 With brightest majesty.
[V3]
 Soon He will be descending 
 For us into the air,
 And we in clouds ascending 
 Caught up unto Him there; 
 He will with exultation
 Set us before Thy throne Of highest exaltation
 Midst glories yet unknown.
