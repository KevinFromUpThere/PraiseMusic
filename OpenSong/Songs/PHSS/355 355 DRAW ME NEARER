 355 DRAW ME NEARER
 I AM Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice, 
 And it told Thy love to me;
 But I long to rise in the arms of faith
 And be closer drawn to Thee.
 Draw me nearer, blessed Lord,
 To the cross where Christ has died; 
 Draw me nearer, blessed Lord,
 To His precious, wounded side.
[V2]
 Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
 By the power of grace divine;
 Let my soul look up with a stedfast hope,
 And my will be lost in Thine.
[V3]
 Oh, the pure delight of a single hour
 That before Thy throne I spend,
 When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God, 
 I commune as friend with friend!
[V4]
 There are depths of love that I cannot know 
 Till I cross the narrow sea;
 There are heights of joy that I may not reach
 Till I rest in peace with Thee.
