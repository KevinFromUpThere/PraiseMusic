  <title>19 TRICHINOPOLY</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE head once full of bruises,
 So full of pain and scorn,
 Midst other sore abuses
 Mocked with a crown of thorn, 
 That head is now surrounded
 With brightest majesty;
 In death once bowed and wounded, 
 Accursed on the tree.
[V2]
 That countenance transcendent, 
 That life-creating Sun
 To worlds on Him dependent,
 Was bruised and spit upon! 
 That which His soul tormented
 Was our sins' heavy load, 
 We had the debt augmented
 Which He then paid in blood.
[V3]
 And oh! what consolation
 Doth in our hearts take place, 
 When we His toil and passion 
 Can joyfully retrace.
 Ah! should we while thus musing 
 On our Redeemer's cross,
 E'en life itself be losing,
 Great gain would be that loss.
[V4]
 We give Thee thanks unfeigned
 For Him the Friend in need, 
 For what His soul sustained
 When He for us did bleed. 
 And now we rest unshaken
 Upon His faithfulness,
 Until we hence are taken
 To see Him face to face.
