<lyrics>[V1]
 IN heaven, before God's holy face, 
 Behold an Advocate
 Who intercedes for us in grace,
 With power divinely great.
[V2]
 He loves us deeply, this we know 
 By tokens that He wears;
 Pierced hands and feet and side, all show 
 The matchless love He bears.
[V3]
 He died to ransom us from sin, 
 He lives to save us still
 From every power without, within, 
 That seeks to work us ill.
[V4]
 He, touched with trials that attend
 The weakness of our frame, 
 Can sympathetic succour lend,
 For He has known the same.
[V5]
 He overcame His mightiest foe,
 When He earth's pathway trod; 
 And victory we may also know,
 Who come through Him to God.
[V6]
 Fear not to come, if sin o'ertake, 
 Confessing all to God,
 Who will forgive us for His sake,
 And cleanse us by His blood.
[V7]
 Christ will fresh strength for conflict give, 
 The needed grace impart,
 That each below for Him may live, 
 And He live in each heart.
