<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Saviour lives, no more to die;
 He lives, our Head, enthroned on high; 
 He lives triumphant o'er the grave;
 He lives eternally to save.
[V2]
 He lives to still His people's fears; 
 He lives to wipe away their tears; 
 He lives their mansions to prepare; 
 He lives to bring them safely there.
[V3]
 Then let our souls in Him rejoice,
 And sing His praise with cheerful voice; 
 Our doubts and fears for ever gone, 
 For Christ is on the Father's throne.
[V4]
 The chief of sinners He receives;
 His saints He loves and never leaves; 
 He'll guard us safe from every ill, 
 And all His promises fulfil.
[V5]
 Abundant grace He will afford
 Till we are present with the Lord, 
 And prove what we have sung before, 
 Christ Jesus lives for evermore.
