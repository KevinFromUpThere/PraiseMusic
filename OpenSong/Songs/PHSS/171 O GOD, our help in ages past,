<lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, our help in ages past,
 Our hope for time to come,
 Our shelter from the stormy blast,
 And our eternal home 
[V2]
 Under the shadow of Thy throne
 Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
 Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
 And our defence is sure. 
[V3]
 Before the hills in order stood
 Or earth received her frame, 
 From everlasting Thou art God,
 To endless years the same.
[V4]
 Thou turnest human flesh to dust;
 "Return, ye sons of men."
 All men are made from dust at first,
 And turn to dust again.
[V5]
 A thousand ages in Thy sight
 Are like an evening gone;
 Short, as the watch that ends the night 
 Before the rising sun.
[V6]
 The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
 With all their joys and cares, 
 Are carried downwards by a flood
 And perish unawares.
[V7]
 Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
 Bears all its sons away;
 They fly forgotten, as a dream 
 Dies at the opening day.
[V8]
 Like flowery fields the nations stand
 Pleased with the morning light;
 The flowers, beneath the mower's hand,
 Lie withering ere 'tis night.
[V9]
 O God, our help in ages past,
 Our hope for time to come,
 Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
 And our eternal home. Amen.
