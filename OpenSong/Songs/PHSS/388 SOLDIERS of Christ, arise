<lyrics>[V1]
 SOLDIERS of Christ, arise 
 And put your armour on,
 Strong in the strength which God supplies 
 Through His eternal Son;
[V2]
 Strong in the Lord of hosts, 
 And in His mighty power.
 Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
 Is more than conqueror.
[V3]
 Stand then in His great might, 
 With all His strength endued;
 And take, to arm you for the fight, 
 The panoply of God.
[V4]
 Leave no unguarded place, 
 No weakness of the soul;
 Take every virtue, every grace,
 And fortify the whole;
[V5]
 That having all things done,
 And all your conflicts passed,
 The victory won through Christ alone,
 To dwell with Him at last.
