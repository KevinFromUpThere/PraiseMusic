<lyrics>[V1]
 THY dying love, O Lord, I own, 
 A love unfathomed and unknown; 
 All other love can measured be, 
 But not Thy boundless love to me.
[V2]
 Oh, wonder to myself I am,
 That I can view the dying Lamb, 
 Can scan the wondrous mystery o'er,
 And not be moved to love Him more!
[V3]
 Not mine, that brought Him from above; 
 And well that 'twas His bitter grief,
 Not mine, that gave my soul relief.
[V4]
 Oh, I am weary of my love,
 That doth so little towards Him move! 
 Yet do I constant, inly groan
 To know the depths of all His own.
[V5]
 Loved and for ever on the throne, 
 Adored and loved, the timeless One 
 Will through one long eternal day 
 The height and depth of all display.
[V6]
 Whilst here below meanwhile I'd be
  Content to have Him near to me; 
 To know but this, His love alone,
 And count my love too mean to own.
