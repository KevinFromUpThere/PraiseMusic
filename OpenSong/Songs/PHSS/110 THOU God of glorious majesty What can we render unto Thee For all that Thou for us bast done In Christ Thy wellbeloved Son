<lyrics>[V1]
 THOU God of glorious majesty, What can we render unto Thee For all that Thou for us bast done In Christ Thy well-beloved Son?
[V2]
 When Israel's sons Thy presence sought, Acceptably to Thee they brought,
 As meet thank-offerings to be,
 The best of that received from Thee.
[V3]
 As reverently Thy courts they trod
 They praised and worshipped Thee, their For victeries Thine arm achieved, [God, For earthly benefits received.
[V4]
 Then what more fitting now can we Give, O Thou blessed God, to Thee Than of the best that Thou hast given, Thy gift of gifts sent down from heaven?
[V5]
 We make confession to His name, Who, loving and obedient, came To do Thy will, to meet our need, For Thee to live, for us to bleed.
[V6]
 Though fails our understanding dull His worth to compass to the full,
 We yet would speak of Him to Thee; Dear to Thyself and us is He.
[V7]
 We would adore Thee, God of love, Because of Him enthroned above, Through whom Thou hast Thyself made Thy purposes eternal shown.	[known,
[V8]
 In His blest name our voice we raise In songs of gratitude and praise;
 Be Thou for evermore adored, Thou holy, wise, all-loving Lord.
