<title>347 HASTEN</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 RISE up and hasten, my soul, haste along,
 And speed on thy journey with hope and with song. 
 Home, home is nearing, 'tis coming into view;
 A little more of toiling, and then to earth adieu.
 Come then, come, and raise your joyful song,
 Ye children of the wilderness, your time cannot be long. 
 Home, home, home! oh why should we delay?
 The morn of heaven is dawning; we're near the break of day.
[V2]
 Why should we linger, when heaven lies before? 
 Earth's fast receding, and soon will be no more;
 Its joys and its treasures, which once here we knew,
 Now never more can charm us with such a goal in view.
[V3]
 Loved ones are with Him, they've passed on before; 
 Resting in glory, they weary are no more;
 Earth's toils are ended, now nothing more but joy,
 And praises loud ascending, their ever glad employ.
[V4]
 No condemnation! how blessed is the word!
 No separation! for ever with the Lord!
 By His blood He bought them, cleansed their every stain;
 With rapture now they praise Him, the Lamb that once was slain.
[V5]
 Soon we shall join them, see Him with these eyes; 
 Sing Hallelujah! triumphant in the skies;
 He will be with us, who loved us long before, 
 Lord Jesus, precious Saviour, is ours for evermore.
