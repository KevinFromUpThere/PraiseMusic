<lyrics>[V1]
 OH, what a comfort 'tis to know
 We have, whate'er betide,
 A mighty Helper here below, 
 Who ever will abide.
[V2]
 The Holy Spirit in His grace,
 With power that must prevail,
 Has deigned to make His dwelling place 
 These mortal bodies frail.
[V3]
 God's holy pledge sent down from heaven
 To seal us for His own; 
 The blessed earnest He has given
 Of joys that shall be known.
[V4]
 Unerring Guide, He leads us in 
 Truth's pathway by the word; 
 And, if our spirits droop within, 
 True comfort will afford.
[V5]
 When we the Father's presence seek
 In child-like faltering prayer,
 He helps our supplications weak 
 By intercessions there.
[V6]
 May we His holy strivings know,
 And to His voice give heed;
 So by Him live and walk and grow, 
 As sons of God indeed.
