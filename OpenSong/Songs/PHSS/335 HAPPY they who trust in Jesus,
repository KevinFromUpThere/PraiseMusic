<title>335 DISMISSAL</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HAPPY they who trust in Jesus,
 Sweet their portion is and sure. 
 While the foe on others seizes,
 He will keep His own secure.
 Happy people!
 Happy though despised and poor.
[V2]
 Since His love and mercy found us,
 We are precious in His sight.
 Thousands now may fall around us,
 Thousands more be put to flight,
 But His presence
 Keeps us safe by day and night.
[V3]
 Lo, our Saviour never slumbers,
 Ever watchful in His care.
 Though we cannot boast of numbers,
  In His strength secure we are. 
 Sweet their portion
 Who our Saviour's kindness share.
[V4]
 As the bird beneath her feathers
 Guards the object of her care, 
 So the Lord His people gathers,
 Spreads His wings and hides them there.
 Thus protected,
 All our foes we boldly dare.
