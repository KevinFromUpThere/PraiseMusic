<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm a pilgrim bound for glory,
 I'm a pilgrim going home;
 Come and hear me tell my story, 
 All who love the Saviour, come.
[V2]
 I will tell you what induced me
 For the better land to start 
 'Twas the Saviour's loving kindness
 Overcame and won my heart.
[V3]
 Faint and weary He has brought me 
 To the fountain of His love;
 Showed me how His blood had bought me, 
 Sealed my pardon from above.
[V4]
 Through the wilderness He's led me,
 Strength in weakness He's bestowed; 
 With the bread of life He's fed me,
 Streams of living water flowed.
