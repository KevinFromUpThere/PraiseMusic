<title>192 PATIENCE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 KEPT, safely kept,
 My fears away are swept;
 In weakness to my God I cling, 
 Though foes be strong I calmly sing, 
 Kept, safely kept.
[V2]
 Kept by His power,
 Whatever dangers lower;
 The strength of God's almighty arm 
 Doth shield my soul from every harm;
 Kept by His power.
[V3]
 Through simple faith,
 Believing what He saith,
 Unshaken on my God I lean,
 And realise His power unseen, 
 But known to faith.
[V4]
 Kept all the way,
 E'en to salvation's day;
 His mighty love ne'er cold shall wax, 
 Nor shall His powerful grasp relax,
 Through all the way.
