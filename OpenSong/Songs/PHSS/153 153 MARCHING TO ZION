 153 MARCHING TO ZION
 COME, ye that love the Lord,
 And let your joys be known;
 Join in a song with sweet accord,
 And thus surround the throne.
 We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion!
 We're marching upward to Zion,
 The beautiful city of God.
[V2]
 Let those refuse to sing
 Who never knew our God;
 But children of the heavenly King
 Must speak their joys abroad.
[V3]
 The hill of Zion yields
 A thousand sacred sweets,
 Before we reach the heavenly fields 
 Or walk the golden streets.
[V4]
 Then let our songs abound,
 And every tear be dry.
 We're marching through this weary land
 To fairer worlds on high.
