  <title>023 Let Us Join Our God to Bless</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 LET us join our God to bless 
 For His Son our righteousness,
 Him who bowed His head so low 
 Underneath our load of woe.
[V2]
 His the curse, the wounds, the gall, 
 His the stripes, He bore them all; 
 His the dying cry of pain
 When our sins He did sustain.
[V3]
 He, the accepted sacrifice,
 From the vanquished grave did rise. 
 Free Himself, He set us free
 In His perfect liberty.
[V4]
 Praise our God who willed it thus, 
 Praise His Son who died for us, 
 Praise the Father for the Son
 Who so vast a work hath done.
