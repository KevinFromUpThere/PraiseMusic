  <lyrics>[V1]
 LO! The infant Saviour lies,
 He appears in lowly guise,
 Yet by faith we read the words,
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V2]
 See! He stands at Pilate's bar, 
 Most despised of all by far; 
 Still to Him belong the words
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V3]
 He who wears the crown of thorns, 
 He whom man reviles and scorns, 
 Yet demands as His the words
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V4]
 On the cross 'tis still the same, 
 Never can He yield His claim 
 To those ever glorious words-
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V5]
 Past the conflict of His love, 
 See He takes His place above;
 On His vesture shine the words
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
