<lyrics>[V1]
 Lo! the infant Saviour lies,
 He appears in lowly guise,
 Yet by faith we read the wordsï¿½King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V2]
 See! He stands at Pilate's bar, Most despised of all by far; Still to Him belong the wordsï¿½
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V3]
 He who wears the crown of thorns, He whom man reviles and scorns, Yet demands as His the wordsï¿½King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V4]
 On the cross 'tis still the same, Never can He yield His claim To those ever glorious words-- King of kings and Lord of lords.
[V5]
 Past the conflict of His love, See He takes His place above;
 On His vesture shine the wordsï¿½King of kings and Lord of lords.
