<lyrics>[V1]
 OH, draw me, Saviour, after Thee! 
 So shall I run and never tire;
 With gracious words still comfort me, 
 Be Thou my hope, my sole desire. 
 Free me from every weight. Nor fear 
 Nor sin can come if Thou art near.
[V2]
 What in Thy love possess I not?
 My star by night, my sun by day,
 My spring of life when parched with drought, 
 My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
 My strength, my shield, my safe abode, 
 My robe before the throne of God.
[V3]
 From all eternity with love
 Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed; 
 Ere knew this beating heart to move, 
 Thy tender mercies me pursued;
 Ever with me may they abide,
 And close me in on every side. Amen.
