<lyrics>[V1]
 OH, what a lonely path were ours,
 Could we, O Father, see
 No home nor rest beyond it all,
 No guide nor help in Thee.
[V2]
 But Thou art near and with us still, 
 To keep us on the way
 That leads along this vale of tears
 To the bright world of day.
[V3]
 Break fully on our view;
 And we, Thy saints, rejoice to prove
 That all Thy word was true.
[V4]
 There Jesus, on the heavenly throne,
 Our wondering eyes shall see; 
 While we the blest associates there
 Of all His joy shall be.
[V5]
 Sweet hope! we leave without a sigh
 A blighted world like this,
 To bear the cross, despise the shame,
 For all that weight of bliss.
[V6]
 Yet little do Thy saints at best
 Endure, O Lord, for Thee,
 Whose suffering soul bore all our sins 
 And sorrows on the tree;
[V7]
 Who faced our fierce, our ruthless foe, 
 Unaided and alone,
 To win or us Thy crown of joy,
 To raise us to Thy throne.
