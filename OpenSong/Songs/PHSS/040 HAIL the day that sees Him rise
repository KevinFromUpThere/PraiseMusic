  <lyrics>[V1]
 HAIL the day that sees Him rise, Hallelujah! 
 To the throne above the skies, Hallelujah! 
 Christ, whose life for us was given, 
 Hallelujah! Enters now the highest heaven, Hallelujah!
[V2]
 There for Him high triumph waits, Hallelujah! 
 Lift your heads, eternal gates, Hallelujah!
 He has conquered death and sin, Hallelujah! 
 Let the King of glory in, Hallelujah!
[V3]
 See, He lifts His hands above, Hallelujah! 
 See, He shows the prints of love, Hallelujah! 
 Hark, His gracious lips bestow, Hallelujah! 
 Blessings on His saints below, Hallelujah!
[V4]
 There for us He intercedes, Hallelujah! 
 His atoning death He pleads, Hallelujah!
 Near Himself prepares our place, Hallelujah! 
 In the riches of His grace, Hallelujah!
[V5]
 Now He's parted from our sight, Hallelujah! 
 Far above the starry height, Hallelujah! 
 Soon for us He'll come again, Hallelujah!
 Christ, who for our sins was slain, Hallelujah!
[V6]
 He shall come and take us home, Hallelujah! 
 From Him we no more shall roam, Hallelujah! 
 Sing His glory, hymn His praise, Hallelujah! 
 Joyful through eternal days, Hallelujah!
