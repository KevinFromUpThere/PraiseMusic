<lyrics>[V1]
 372 CALL THEM IN
 CALL them in, the poor, the wretched,
 Sin-stained wanderers from the fold; 
 Peace and pardon freely offer;
 Can you weigh their worth with gold? 
 Call them in, the weak, the weary,
 Laden with the doom of sin;
 Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
 He is waiting—call them in.
[V2]
 Call them in, the Jew, the Gentile,
 Bid the strangers to the feast; 
 Call them in, the rich, the noble,
 From the highest to the least;
 Forth the Father runs to meet them,
 He hath all their sorrows seen; 
 Robe and ring and royal sandals
 Wait the lost ones—call them in.
[V3]
 Call them in, the broken-hearted,
 Cowering 'neath the brand of shame; 
 Speak love's message, low and tender,
 " 'Twas for sinners Jesus came." 
 See the shadows lengthen round us,
 Soon the day-dawn will begin;
 Can you leave them lost and lonely?
 Christ is waiting—call them in.
