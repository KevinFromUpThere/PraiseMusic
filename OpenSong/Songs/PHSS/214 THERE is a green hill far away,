<lyrics>[V1]
 THERE is a green hill far away,
 Outside a city wall,
 Where Christ the Lord was crucified,
 Who died to save us all.
[V2]
 We do not know, we cannot tell
 The pains He had to bear; 
 But this we know, it was for us
 He bled and suffered there. 
[V3]
 He died that we might be forgiven,
 That we so void of good
 Might ever be with Him in heaven, 
 Saved by His precious blood.
[V4]
 There was no other good enough
 To pay the price of sin;
 He only could unlock the gate
 Of heaven, to let us in.
[V5]
 Oh dearly, dearly has He loved!
 Shall we not love Him too,
 Who trust in His redeeming blood,
 And seek His will to do?
