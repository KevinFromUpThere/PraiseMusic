  <title>44 MOUNT EPHRAIM</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lord is risen indeed! 
 Then Justice asks no more;
 Mercy and Truth are now agreed,
 Who stood opposed before.
[V2]
 The Lord is risen indeed! 
 Then is His work performed;
 The captive Surety now is freed, 
 And death our foe disarmed.
[V3]
 The Lord is risen indeed!
 He lives to die no more,
 He lives His people's cause to plead, 
 Whose curse and shame He bore.
[V4]
 The Lord is risen indeed!
 Hades has lost its prey;
 And with Him all the ransomed seed 
 Shall reign in endless day.
