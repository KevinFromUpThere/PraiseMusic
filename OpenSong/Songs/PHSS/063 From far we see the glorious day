  <lyrics>[V1]
 FROM far we see the glorious day 
 When He who bore our sins away 
 Will all His majesty display.
[V2]
 A Man of Sorrows once He was;
 No friend was found to plead His cause, 
 For all preferred the world's applause.
[V3]
 He groaned beneath sin's awful load, 
 For in the sinner's place He stood, 
 And died to bring us nigh to God.
[V4]
 But now He reigns with glory crowned, 
 While angel hosts the throne surround, 
 And still His lofty praises sound.
[V5]
 And there is yet a day to come
 When He who suffered in our room 
 Will take His waiting people home.
