<title>50 STUTTGART</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, ten thousand voices crying,
 "Lamb of God," with one accord! Thousand, thousand saints replying
 Wake at once the echoing chord.
[V2]
 Praise the Lamb! the chorus waking,
 All in heaven together throng; Loud and far, each tongue partaking,
 Rolls along the endless song.
[V3]
 Grateful incense this ascending
 Ever to the Father's throne; Every knee to Jesus bending,
 All the mind of heaven is one.
[V4]
 All the Father's counsels claiming
 Equal honours to the Son;
 All the Son's effulgence beaming Makes the Father's glory known.
[V5]
 By the Spirit all pervading,
 Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb Crowd with light and joy unfading, Hail Him as the great I AM.
[V6]
 Joyful now the wide creation
 Rests in undisturbed repose, Blest in Jesus' full salvation
 Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.
[V7]
 Hark! the heavenly notes of praises.ï¿½Loudly swells the song again;
 Joy responsive "Amen ! " raises, Hallelujah, and Amen!
 KING of kings and Lord of lordsï¿½These great awe-inspiring words Unto Christ the Lord belong;
 Let His people raise their song.
[V2]
 Glory, honour, praise and power, These are His for evermore.
 He is on the throne above,
 Jesus, who told out God's love.
[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy Lord,
 Heaven and earth His name record. Power and praise to Him belong, "He is worthy," is our song.
[V4]
 Rich in glory, Christ did stoop, Thence is all His people's hope. He was poor that we might be Rich with Him eternally.
