<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus, Lord Jesus, 
 How vast Thy love to me!
 I'll bathe in its full ocean 
 To all eternity,
 And wending on to glory
 This all my song shall be, 
 "I was a guilty sinner,
 But Thou hast died for me."
[V2]
 Oh Calv'ry, oh Calv'ry,
 The thorn-crown and the spear¬
 'Tis here Thy love, Lord Jesus,
 Thy grievous wounds appear. 
 What depths of grace and mercy 
 So richly flow from Thee!
 I was a guilty sinner,
 But Thou hast died for me.
[V3]
 Adore Him, adore Him;
 The glorious work is done.
 Sin's judgment ne'er will harm me;
 'Twas laid upon God's Son.
 He suffering cried, "'Tis finished,"
 And I my pardon see;
 I was a guilty sinner,
 But Thou hast died for me.
[V4]
 In glory, in glory,
 For ever with the Lord, 
 I with the heavenly chorus
 Shall sing with sweet accord; 
 And as I gaze upon Him,
 My gladsome song shall be 
 Melodious with the praises 
 Of Christ who died for me.
