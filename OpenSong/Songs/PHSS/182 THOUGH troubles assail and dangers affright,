<title>182 HOUGHTON</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THOUGH troubles assail and dangers affright,
 Though friends should all fail and foes all unite; 
 Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide—
 The Scripture assures us, "The Lord will provide."
[V2]
 The birds, without barn or storehouse, are fed;
 From them let us learn to trust for our bread. 
 His saints what is fitting shall ne'er be denied, 
 So long as 'tis written, "The Lord will provide."
[V3]
 His call to obey, like Abram of old
 Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold; 
 For though we are strangers we have a good guide, 
 And trust in all dangers; "The Lord will provide."
[V4]
 No strength of our own or goodness we claim;
 Yet since we have known the Saviour's great name, 
 In this our strong tower for safety we hide,
 Almighty His power; "The Lord will provide."
