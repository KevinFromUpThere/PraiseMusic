<lyrics>[V1]
 SALVATION to our God
 Who did provide the Lambï¿½The merit of His precious blood
 Our only claim.
 Our God salvation gives,
 And through His Son it flows; Once slain for us, for us He lives,
 Our sole repose.
[V2]
 He who was slain is seen
 On God's eternal throne;
 And His redeemed are white and clean Through Him alone. Salvation's joyful sound
 Bursts from the blood-bought throng, And soon creation all around
 Shall join the song.
[V3]
 Our hearts are tuned for this, Glad songs our tongues employ;
 Christ is the spring of all our bliss,
 And God our joy.
 Salvation to our God,
 Thanksgiving, power and might,
 For Him who cleansed us by His blood, Our Life and Light. Amen.
