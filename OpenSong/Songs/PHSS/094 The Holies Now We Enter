  <title>094 The Holies Now We Enter</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE Holies now we enter
 In perfect peace with God, 
 Regaining the lost centre
 Through Christ's atoning blood; 
 Though great may be our dulness
 In thought and word and deed, 
 We glory in the fulness
 Of Him who meets our need.
[V2]
 Much incense is ascending
 Before th' eternal throne; 
 God graciously is bending
 To listen to His own.
 Though feeble are our praises
 Christ adds His sweet perfume, 
 And love the censer raises
 Their odours to consume.
[V3]
 O God, we come with singing
 Because the great High Priest 
 Our names to Thee is bringing,
 Nor e'er forgets the least. 
 For us He wears the mitre
 Where holiness shines bright; 
 For us His robes are whiter 
 Than heaven's unsullied light.
