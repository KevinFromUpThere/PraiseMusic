<title>315 SAMSON</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HAPPY am I! a gracious Friend
 To dwell with me doth condescend; 
 Though oft my foolish thoughts may roam, 
 This Friend still makes my heart His home.
[V2]
 When I in Christ the Lord believed, 
 And everlasting life received,
 He sent His Spirit from above, 
 That I might understand His love.
[V3]
 'Twas He who made me know my sin, 
 By nature Wicked and unclean;
 'Twas He revealed the Son of God; 
 And all the virtue of His blood.
[V4]
 'Tis He who teaches me to pray 
 To God my Father every day; 
 To find my pleasure in the Lord, 
 And in His holy written word.
[V5]
 When like a sheep I go astray
 And turn to mine own foolish way, 
 He brings me back in love and grace, 
 Again to seek my Father's face.
[V6]
 He teaches me I'm very frail, 
 But by His help I can prevail 
 O'er Satan, sin, and every foe 
 Whom I may meet while here below.
[V7]
 For Christ, my Master's quick return, 
 'Tis He who teaches me to yearn;
 The Paraclete, who, wondrous grace! 
 Makes my poor heart His dwelling place.
