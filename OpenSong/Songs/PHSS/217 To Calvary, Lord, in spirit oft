<title>217 ST. VALENTINE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 To Calvary, Lord, in spirit oft
 Our weary souls repair,
 To dwell upon Christ's dying love,
 And taste its sweetness there.
[V2]
 Sweet resting place of every heart
 That feels the plague of sin,
 Yet knows that deep mysterious joy, 
 The peace of God within.
[V3]
 There, through that hour of deepest woe, 
 His suffering spirit passed;
 Grace there its wondrous victory gained, 
 And love endured its last.
[V4]
 Dear suffering Lamb! His grievous wounds
 Have drawn, with cords of love,
 Our willing hearts to Him, and linked 
 Our life with His above.
[V5]
 His sympathies and hopes are ours; 
 O God, we wait to see
 Creation all, below, above,
 By Him redeemed and free.
[V6]
 Our longing eyes would fain behold
 That bright and blessed brow,
 Once wrung with bitterest anguish, wear 
 Its crown of glory now.
[V7]
 Why linger then? Come, Saviour come, 
 Responsive to our call;
 Come, claim Thy rightful power and reign 
 The Heir and Lord of all.
