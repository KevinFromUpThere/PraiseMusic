<title>359 HESPERUS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Go, labour on, spend and be spent ; 
 Thy joy to do the Father's will.
 It is the way the Master went;
 Should not the servant tread it still?
[V2]
 Go, labour on; tis not for nought; 
 Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain.
 Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; 
 The Master praises; what are men?
[V3]
 Go, labour on; your hands are weak, 
 Your knees are faint, your soul cast down ; 
 Yet falter not; the prize you seek
 Is near, a kingdom and a crown.
[V4]
 Go, labour on while it is day;
 The world's dark night is hastening on. 
 Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away; 
 It is not thus that souls are won.
[V5]
 Men die in darkness at your side, 
 Without a hope to cheer the tomb. 
 Take up the torch and wave it wide,
 The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.
[V6]
 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray, 
 Be wise the erring soul to win;
 Go forth into the world's highway, 
 Compel the wanderer to come in.
[V7]
 Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
 For toil comes rest, for exile home. 
 Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice, 
 The midnight cry, " Behold, I come!"
