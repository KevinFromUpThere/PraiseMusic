  <lyrics>[V1]
 DONE is the work that saves, 
 Once and for ever done!
 Finished the righteousness
 That clothes th' unrighteous one! 
 The love that blesses us below
 Is flowing freely to us now.
[V2]
 The sacrifice is o'er,
 The veil is rent in twain,
 The mercy-seat is red
 With blood of Victim slain.
 Why stand we, then, without in fear? 
 The blood of Christ invites us near.
[V3]
 The gate is open wide,
 The new and living way
 Is clear and free and bright
 With love and peace and day.
 Into the Holies now we come
 Our present and eternal home.
[V4]
 Enthroned in majesty
 The great Priest sits within.
 The precious blood once shed 
 Has made and keeps us clean.
 With boldness let us now draw near,
 That blood has banished every fear.
[V5]
 To Him who has been slain
 Be glory, praise and power;
 He died, and lives again,
 He lives for evermore.
 He loves us, cleansed us by His blood, 
 Made us a kingdom, priests to God.
