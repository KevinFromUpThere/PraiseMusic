<title>195 ANGELS' STORY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lord thy God is with thee,
 Where'er thy pathway lie, 
 In summer's shining hours,
 Or 'neath dull winter's sky. 
 In all thy joys and blessings
 His hand has its full share; 
 Whilst oft-times in thy sorrow,
 His purposes lie there. 
[V2]
 The Lord thy God is with thee;
 Then bright shall be the dawn 
 Of day that bringeth victory,
 The fruit of sorrows borne.
 And looking o'er thy pathway,
 With joy thou then wilt say,
 "The Lord my God was with me
 Each moment of the day."
[V3]
 The Lord thy God is with thee, 
 He seeth every tear;
 Thy weight of grief He knoweth,
 Thou still to Him art dear.
 Thy prayers, e'en though unuttered,
 Pent in thine aching heart,
 The Lord thy God doth hear them,
 And with thee bears a part.
[V4]
 The Lord thy God is with thee,
 Although thy way seem hard;
  In keeping His commandments
 Thine is a sure reward.
 Though called to suffer hardship
 In fighting for His name,
 The Lord thy God is with thee,
 His promise still the same.
[V5]
 The Lord thy God is with thee,
 O saint, do not despair;
 His mighty arm is round thee;
 Confide in Him thy care.
 If e'er thou growest weary
 And feel'st how weak thy strength, 
 Forget not He is with thee;
 Thou must o'ercome at length.
