<lyrics>[V1]
 O LOVE divine, how sweet thou art! 
 When shall I find my willing heart 
 All taken up by thee?
 Oh, may I pant and thirst to prove 
 The greatness of redeeming love, 
 The love of God to me!
[V2]
 God only knows the love of God; 
 Oh, that it more were shed abroad
 In this poor heart of mine! 
 For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
 This only portion, Lord, be mine,
 Be mine the better part.
[V3]
 Oh, that I may for ever sit,
 Like Mary, at the Master's feet—
 Be this my happy choice;
 My only care, my only bliss,
 My joy, my heaven on earth be this, 
 To hear the Bridegroom's voice.
[V4]
 Oh, that I may, like favoured John, 
 Recline my wearied head upon
 The great Redeemer's breast! 
 From care and sin and sorrow free, 
 Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee
 My everlasting rest.
