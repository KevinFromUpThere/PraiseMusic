<lyrics>[V1]
 BLEST are the pure in heart, 
 For they shall see their God;
 The secret of the Lord is theirs, 
 Their soul is Christ's abode.
[V2]
 The Lord, who left the heavens 
 Our life and peace to bring,
 To dwell in lowliness with men, 
 Their pattern and their King;
[V3]
 Still to the lowly soul
 He doth Himself impart,
 And for His dwelling and His throne 
 Chooseth the pure in heart.
[V4]
 Lord, we Thy presence seek, 
 May ours this blessing be;
 Give us a pure and lowly heart,
 A temple meet for Thee.
