<lyrics>[V1]
 363 MORE TO FOLLOW 
 HAVE you on the Lord believed? 
 Still there's more to follow.
 Of His grace have you received? 
 Still there's more to follow.
 Oh the grace the Father shows! 
 Still there's more to follow.
 Freely He His grace bestows, 
 Still there's more to follow.
 More and more, more and more,
 Always more to follow;
 Oh His matchless, boundless love ! 
 Still there's more to follow.
[V2]
 Have you felt the Saviour near? 
 Still there's more to follow.
 Does His blessed presence cheer?
 Still there's more to follow.
 Oh, the love Christ Jesus shows! 
 Still there's more to follow.
 Freely He His love bestows; 
 Still there's more to follow.
[V3]
 Have you felt the Spirit's power?
 Still there's more to follow. 
 Falling like the gentle shower?
 Still there's more to follow. 
 Oh, the power the Spirit shows!
 Still there's more to follow. 
 Freely He His power bestows;
 Still there's more to follow.
