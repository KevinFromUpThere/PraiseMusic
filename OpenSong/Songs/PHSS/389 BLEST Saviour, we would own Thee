<lyrics>[V1]
 BLEST Saviour, we would own Thee
 Amid the world's proud scorn,
 The world that mocked, and crowned Thee
 With diadem of thorn.
 The world that now rejects Thee,
 Makes nothing of Thy love, Counts not the grace and pity
 That brought Thee from above. 
[V2]
 O Lord, O Master, help us
 To walk apart with Thee, 
 Outside the camp, where only 
 Thy beauty we may see;
 Far from the world's loud turmoil, 
 Far from its busy din,
 Far from its praise and honour, 
 Its unbelief and sin.
[V3]
 Oh, keep each heart at leisure
 From all the world beside,
 In close communion ever
 Thus with Thee to abide;
 So all Thy whispered breathings
 Of love and truth to hear, 
 And hail Thee with rejoicing
 When Thou shalt soon appear.
