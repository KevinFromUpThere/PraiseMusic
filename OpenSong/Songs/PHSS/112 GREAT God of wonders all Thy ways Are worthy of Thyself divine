<lyrics>[V1]
 GREAT God of wonders, all Thy ways Are worthy of Thyself, divine,
 But the bright glories of Thy grace Beyond Thine other wonders shine. Who is a pardoning God like Thee, Or who hath grace so rich and free?
[V2]
 Such deep transgressions to forgive, Such guilty daring worms to spareï¿½This is Thy grand prerogative,
 And in this honour none shall share. Who is a pardoning God like Thee, Or who hath grace so rich and free?
 Pardon from an offended God,
 Pardon for sins of deepest dye,
 Pardon bestowed through Jesus blood, Pardon that brings the rebel nigh; Who is a pardoning God like Thee, Or who hath grace so rich and free?
