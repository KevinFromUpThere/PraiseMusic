<lyrics>[V1]
 BEHOLD the Lord with glory crowned, To Him all power is given;
 No place too high for Him is found, No place too high in heaven.
[V2]
 He fills the throne, the throne above, He fills it without wrong;
 The object of His Father's love,
 The theme of angels' song.
 Though high yet He presents the praise God's people offer here;
 The faintest, feeblest lay they raise
 Will reach the Father's ear.
[V4]
 This song be ours, and this alone That celebrates the fame
 Of Him who sits upon the throne, And that exalts His name.
[V5]
 To Him whom men despise and slight, To Him be glory given.
 The crown is His, and His by right
 The highest place in heaven.
