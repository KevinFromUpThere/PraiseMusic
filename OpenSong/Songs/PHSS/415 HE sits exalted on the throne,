<title>415 PEMBROKE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HE sits exalted on the throne,
 To us as mighty Saviour known, 
 Our one and only Lord;
 He waits with keen, expectant gaze, 
 The coming of that day of days, 
 The day of His reward!
[V2]
 Without delay He then shall rise,
 And loud, triumphant through the skies
 His gladsome shout will sound; 
 Archangel voice and trump of God 
 Shall waken saints beneath the sod,
 The spacious world around.
[V3]
 In bodies incorrupt shall stand,
 In this and many another land,
 Those who in Christ have died; 
 We too, who then alive remain, 
 Shall see an end of all our pain,
[V4]
 The Master's mighty, quickening voice 
 Will make our every heart rejoice, 
 And then His face we'll see;
 'Twas once for us all bruised and marred,
  His brow with cruel thorn was scarred;
 They nailed Him to the tree!
[V5]
 But then His face in glory bright 
 Shall fill our wondering, ravished sight, 
 And we like Him shall be.
 Like Him in all those lovely traits, 
 Which in His lowly, earthly days 
 So beautiful we see.
[V6]
 Before the holy judgment throne 
 We'll see, as we in awe bow down, 
 Our works in fire be tried.
 In view of that devouring flame,
 Be this our prayer, and this our aim—
 "In Him may we abide."
