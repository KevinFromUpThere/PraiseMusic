<title>317 WILLIS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I LEFT it all with Jesus
 Long ago;
 All my sins I brought Him,
 And my woe.
 When by faith I saw Him
 On the tree,
 Heard His still small whisper,
 " 'Tis for thee,"
 From my heart the burden 
 Rolled away, Happy day!
[V2]
 I leave it all with Jesus,
  For He knows
 How to steal the bitter
 From life's woes;
 How to gild the tear-drop 
 With His smile;
 Make the desert garden 
 Bloom awhile.
 When my weakness leaneth
 On His might,
 All seems light. 
[V3]
 I leave it all with Jesus Day by day;
 Faith can firmly trust Him,
 Come what may.
 Hope has dropped her anchor,
 Found her rest In the calm, sure haven
 Of His breast.
 Love esteems it heaven
 To abide
 At His side.
[V4]
 I leave myself with Jesus,
 For He keeps
 Watch o'er all His creatures,
 And ne'er sleeps.
 Worlds on worlds are hanging
 On His hand,
 Life and death are waiting
 His command,
 Yet His tender bosom
 Makes me room; 
 'Tis my home.
