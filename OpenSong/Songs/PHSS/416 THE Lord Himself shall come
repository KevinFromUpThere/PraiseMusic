<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lord Himself shall come
 And shout the quickening word; 
 Thousands shall answer from the tomb, 
 "For ever with the Lord."
[V2]
 Then  as we upward fly,
 That resurrection word
 Shall be the shout of victory¬
 “For ever with the Lord.”
[V3]
 How shall I meet those eyes?
 Mine on Himself I'll cast,
 And own myself the Saviour's prize; 
 Mercy from first to last.
[V4]
 Knowing as I am known, 
 How shall I love that word,
 How oft repeat before the throne, 
 "For ever with the Lord!"
[V5]
 That resurrection word,
 That shout of victory,
 Once more, "For ever with the Lord," 
 Amen, so let it be!
