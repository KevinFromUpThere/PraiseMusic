<title>157 PETERBOROUGH</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THE spacious firmament on high, 
 With all the blue ethereal sky,
 And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
 Their great Original proclaim.
 Th' unwearied sun from day to day 
 Does his Creator's power display, 
 And publishes to every land
 The work of an almighty hand.
[V2]
 Soon as the evening shades prevail 
 The moon takes up the wondrous tale, 
 And nightly to the listening earth 
 Repeats the story of her birth;
 While all the stars that round her burn, 
 And all the planets in their turn, 
 Confirm the tidings as they roll,
 And spread the truth from pole to pole.
[V3]
 What though in solemn silence all 
 Move round the dark terrestrial ball? 
 What though no real voice or sound 
 Amidst their radiant orbs be found? 
 In reason's ear they all rejoice
 And utter forth a glorious voice; 
 For ever singing as they shine, 
 "The hand that made us is divine."
