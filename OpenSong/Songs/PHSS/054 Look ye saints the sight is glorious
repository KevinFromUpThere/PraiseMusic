<lyrics>[V1]
 Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
 See the Man of Sorrows now!
 From the fight returned victorious,
 Every knee to Him shall bow.
 God has crowned Him,
 Crowns become the Victor's brow.
[V2]
 See the Saviour God has crowned!
 Rich the trophies that He brings; In the seat of power enthroned,
 While the vault of heaven rings.
 God has crowned Him,
 Crowned the Saviour King of kings.
[V3]
 Sinners in derision crowned Him,
 Mocking thus the Saviour's claim; Saints and angels crowd around Him,
 Own His title, praise His name.
 God has crowned Him,
 Sing aloud the Victor's fame.
[V4]
 Hark! those bursts of acclamation, Hark ! those loud triumphant chords ; Jesus takes the highest station,
 Oh, what joy the sight affords! Hallelujah!
 God has crowned Him,
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
