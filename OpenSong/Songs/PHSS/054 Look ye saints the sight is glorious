  <lyrics>[V1]
 Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
 See the Man of Sorrows now!
 From the fight returned victorious,
 Every knee to Him shall bow.
 Hallelujah!
 God has crowned Him,
 Crowns become the Victor's brow.
[V2]
 See the Saviour God has crowned!
 Rich the trophies that He brings; 
 In the seat of power enthroned,
 While the vault of heaven rings.
 Hallelujah!
 God has crowned Him,
 Crowned the Saviour King of kings.
[V3]
 Sinners in derision crowned Him,
 Mocking thus the Saviour's claim; 
 Saints and angels crowd around Him,
 Own His title, praise His name.
 God has crowned Him,
 Hallelujah!
 Sing aloud the Victor's fame.
[V4]
 Hark! those bursts of acclamation, 
 Hark! those loud triumphant chords; 
 Jesus takes the highest station,
 Oh, what joy the sight affords! 
 Hallelujah!
 God has crowned Him,
 King of kings and Lord of lords.
