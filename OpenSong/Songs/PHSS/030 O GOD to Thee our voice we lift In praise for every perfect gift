<lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, to Thee our voice we lift In praise for every perfect gift
 Thou sendest from above.
 In daily boons bestowed by Thee Thou hast declared Thyself to be
 A God of grace and love. 
 But oh, Thy Son, from heaven sent, Has love's unlimited extent,
 Its shoreless ocean, shown.
 For Him, our songs to Thee we raise In thankful gratitude and praise,
 The gift that makes Thee known.
[V7]
 What love it was, that Thou shouldst give Thy Son to death that we might live, Who bore no love to Thee!
 No thanks we gave for aught bestowed, But by our every action showed
 What enemies were we.
[V8]
 But now we love, for love expressed In giving us Thy very bestï¿½
 Thy well-beloved Son.
 We praise Thee, worship and adore, Who opened thus love's boundless store And gave that blessed One.
[V9]
 Oh, wondrous gift, in whom we find Thine every heavenly gift combined; Our all-in-all is He.
 Our life, our peace, our righteousness; All that we have and shall possess, We have in Him, from Thee.
 To Thee is highest glory due, And ages shall its weight accrue,
 For this that Thou hast done. So now we'd join that mighty song That age on age shall echo on,
 Praise for Thy giftï¿½Thy Son.
