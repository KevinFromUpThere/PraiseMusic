  <title>58 EGYPT</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE mighty work is done; 
 He who the victory won
 No more will die; He lives on high,
 His triumph loud we sing,
 Our praise to God we bring
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!
 God has raised Him from the dead; 
 Now He lives our glorious Head.
[V2]
 He entered heaven by blood; 
 Upon the throne of God
 He sitteth now: to Him all bow; 
 His priceless worth we sing, 
 Our praise to God we bring-
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 God has seated Him on high, 
 And by Him we are brought nigh.
[V3]
 He comes soon to the air,
 And we shall meet Him there,
 Oh glorious hour of heavenly power! 
 Then gladsome songs we'll sing, 
 And heaven's high vault shall ring.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 We shall know His love and grace 
 When we look upon His face.
[V4]
 He comes to earth to reign, 
 The Lamb that once was slain.
 His bounteous hand in every land 
 Proclaims Him heaven's King. 
 All people then shall sing
 Soon He comes to earth again
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!
 As the King of kings to reign.
