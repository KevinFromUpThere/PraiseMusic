  <title>58 EGYPT</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE mighty work is done; 
 He who the victory won
 No more will die; He lives on high,
 His triumph loud we sing,
 Our praise to God we bring
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!
 God has raised Him from the dead; 
 Now He lives our glorious Head.
[V2]
 He entered heaven by blood; 
 Upon the throne of God
 He sitteth now: to Him all bow; 
 His priceless worth we sing, 
 Our praise to God we bring-
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 God has seated Him on high, 
 And by Him we are brought nigh.
[V3]
 He comes soon to the air,
 And we shall meet Him there,
 Oh glorious hour of heavenly power! 
 Then gladsome songs we'll sing, 
 And heaven's high vault shall ring.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 We shall know His love and grace 
 When we look upon His face.
[V4]
 He comes to earth to reign, 
 The Lamb that once was slain.
 His bounteous hand in every land 
 Proclaims Him heaven's King. 
 All people then shall sing
 Soon He comes to earth again
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!
 As the King of kings to reign.

[V1]
 THE veil is rent! Lo, Jesus sits
 Upon a throne of grace;
 The incense which His name emits
 Fills all that glorious place.
[V2]
 His precious blood is sprinkled there 
 Before and on the throne,
 And His own wounds in heaven declare 
 His work on earth is done.
[V3]
 "'Tis finished," on the cross He said 
 In agonies and blood;
 "'Tis finished," now He lives to plead 
 Before the face of God.
[V4]
 "'Tis finished," here our souls can rest, 
 His work can never fail;
 By Him, our sacrifice and Priest,
 We enter through the veil.
[V5]
 Within the Holiest of all,
 Cleansed by His precious blood, 
 Before Thy throne Thy people fall 
 And worship Thee, O God.
[V6]
 Boldly our heart and voice we raise, 
 His name, His blood, our plea, 
 Assured our sacrifice of praise
 Ascends by Him to Thee. 

[V1]
 'Tis past, the dark and dreary night; 
 O God, we see Him now,
 Our morning Star, without a cloud 
 Of sadness on His brow.
[V2]
 His path on earth, the cross, the grave, 
 His sorrows, all are o'er;
 And oh, sweet thought! His eye shall weep, 
 His heart shall break no more.
[V3]
 Deep were those sorrows, deeper still
 The love that brought Him low,
 That bade the streams of life from Him
 A lifeless Victim flow.
[V4]
 The soldier, as he pierced Him, proved 
 Man's hate to Him and Thee,
 Whilst in the blood that stained the spear 
 His love and Thine we see.
[V5]
 It is not that we know the joy
 Of cancelled sin alone,
 But happier far, the saints are called
 To share His glorious throne.
[V6]
 So closely are we linked in love 
 (As dear as He to Thee)
 That all His bliss and glory soon
 Our portion blest shall be.
 
[V1]
 DONE is the work that saves, 
 Once and for ever done!
 Finished the righteousness
 That clothes th' unrighteous one! 
 The love that blesses us below
 Is flowing freely to us now.
[V2]
 The sacrifice is o'er,
 The veil is rent in twain,
 The mercy-seat is red
 With blood of Victim slain.
 Why stand we, then, without in fear? 
 The blood of Christ invites us near.
[V3]
 The gate is open wide,
 The new and living way
 Is clear and free and bright
 With love and peace and day.
 Into the Holies now we come
 Our present and eternal home.
[V4]
 Enthroned in majesty
 The great Priest sits within.
 The precious blood once shed 
 Has made and keeps us clean.
 With boldness let us now draw near,
 That blood has banished every fear.
[V5]
 To Him who has been slain
 Be glory, praise and power;
 He died, and lives again,
 He lives for evermore.
 He loves us, cleansed us by His blood, 
 Made us a kingdom, priests to God.
