<lyrics>[V1]
 THROUGH the love of God Our Saviour
 All will be well;
 Free and changeless is His favour,
 All will be well;
 Precious is the blood that healed us,
 Perfect is the grace that sealed us,
 Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us, 
 All will be well.
[V2]
 Though we pass through tribulation,
 All will be well; 
 Ours is such a full salvation,
 All, all is well; 
 Happy still in God confiding, 
 Fruitful if in Christ abiding,
 Holy through the Spirit's guiding,
 All must be well.
[V3]
 We expect a bright tomorrow,
 All will be well;
 Faith can sing through days of sorrow,
 All, all is well;
 On our Father's love relying,
 He our every need supplying,
 Or in living or in dying,
 All must be well.
