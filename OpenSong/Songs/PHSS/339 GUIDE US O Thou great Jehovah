  <lyrics>[V1]
 GUIDE US, O Thou great Jehovah,
 Pilgrims through this barren land; 
 We are weak, but Thou art mighty,
 Hold us with Thy powerful hand.
 Bread of heaven,
 Feed us now and evermore.
[V2]
 Open wide the living fountain 
 Whence the healing waters flow;
 Be Thyself our fiery pillar
 All the desert journey through.
 Strong Deliverer,
 Be Thou still our strength and shield.
[V3]
 While we tread this vale of sorrow
 May we in Thy love abide.
 Keep us, O Thou gracious Saviour,
 Cleaving closely to Thy side;
 Still relying
 On our Father's changeless love.
[V4]
 Saviour come, we long to see Thee
 Long to dwell with Thee above, 
 And to know in full communion
 All the sweetness of Thy love.
 Come, Lord Jesus,
 Take Thy waiting people home.
