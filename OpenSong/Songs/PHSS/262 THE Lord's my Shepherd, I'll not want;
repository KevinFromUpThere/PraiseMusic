<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want; 
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green; He leadeth me 
 The quiet waters by.
[V2]
 My soul He doth restore again;
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness,
 E'en for His own name's sake.
[V3]
 Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, 
 Yet will I fear none ill;
 For Thou art with me, and Thy rod 
 And staff me comfort still.
[V4]
 My table Thou hast furnished
 In presence of my foes;
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint, 
 And my cup overflows.
[V5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life 
 Shall surely follow me;
 And in God's house for evermore
 My dwelling place shall be.
