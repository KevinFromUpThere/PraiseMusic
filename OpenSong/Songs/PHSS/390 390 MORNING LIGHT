<lyrics>[V1]
 390 MORNING LIGHT
 STAND bravely for your Master,
 Ye soldiers of the cross; Lift high His royal banner,
 It must not suffer loss. From victory unto victory
 His army will He lead,
 Till every foe is vanquished,
 And Christ is Lord indeed.
[V2]
 Stand bravely for your Master, 
 The trumpet call obey,
 Forth to the mighty conflict
 In this most glorious day.
 Ye that are men now serve Him
 Against unnumbered foes;
 Let courage rise with danger,
 And strength to strength oppose.
[V3]
 Stand bravely for your Master,
 Stand in His strength alone; 
 The arm of flesh will fail you,
 Ye dare not trust your own. 
 Put on the gospel armour,
 And, watching unto prayer, 
 Where duty calls to danger
 Be never wanting there.
[V4]
 Stand bravely for your Master,
 The strife will not be long; 
 This day the noise of battle,
 The next the victor's song. 
 To him that overcometh
 A crown of life shall be;
 He with the King of glory
 Shall reign eternally.
