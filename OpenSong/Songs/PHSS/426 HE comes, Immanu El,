<lyrics>[V1]
 HE comes, Immanu El,
 Who once was crucified,
 The Man of Sorrows He,
 Who bowed His head and died; 
 He hath redeemed us by His blood, 
 He comes to take us home to God.
[V2]
 He comes, our Advocate,
 Who bears us on His breast, 
 Himself to take us home
 To His eternal rest.
 Oh, let this hope dispel each fear,
 Our great High Priest will soon appear.
[V3]
 He comes, our Shepherd comes 
 Whose eyelids never sleep,
 To gather in the skies
 The myriads of His sheep. 
 Where the eternal fountains spring 
 Of love divine, His flock He'll bring.
[V4]
 He comes, the Heir of all;
 All shall His power obey.
 The Bridegroom to His Church 
 His glories shall display.
 But oh, His love what tongue can tell, 
[V5]
  Responsive to this word 
 The Spirit and the Bride Cry, 
 "Even so, O Lord;
 Nought else can satisfy her heart,
 But to be with Thee where Thou art."
