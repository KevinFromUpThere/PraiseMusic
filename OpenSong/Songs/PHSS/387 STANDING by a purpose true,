<title>387 DANIEL</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 STANDING by a purpose true,
 Heeding God's command,
 Honour them, the faithful few!
 All hail to Daniel's band!
 Dare to be a Daniel!
 Dare to stand alone!
 Dare to have a purpose firm!
 Dare to make it known!
[V2]
 Many mighty men are lost,
 Daring not to stand,
 Who for God had been a host,
 By joining Daniel's band.
