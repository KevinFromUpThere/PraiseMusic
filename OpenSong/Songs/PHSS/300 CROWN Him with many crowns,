<title>300 DIADEMATA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 CROWN Him with many crowns, 
 The Lamb upon His throne;
 Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns 
 All music but its own!
 Awake, my soul, and sing
 Of Him who died for thee,
 And hail Him as thy matchless King, 
 Through all eternity.
[V2]
 Crown Him the Lord of life,
 Who triumphed o'er the grave,
 And rose victorious in the strife 
 For those He came to save. 
 His glories now we sing, 
 Who died, and rose on high;
 Who died eternal life to bring, 
 And lives that death may die.
[V3]
 Crown Him the Lord of love; 
 Behold His hands and side—
 Those wounds yet visible above
 In beauty glorified.
 No angel in the sky
 Can fully bear that sight,
 But downward bends his burning eye 
 At mysteries so bright.
[V4]
 Crown Him the Lord of years, 
 The Potentate of time,
 Creator of the rolling spheres,
 Ineffably sublime!
 All hail, Redeemer, hail! 
 For Thou hast died for me;
 Thy praise shall never, never fail
 Throughout eternity.
