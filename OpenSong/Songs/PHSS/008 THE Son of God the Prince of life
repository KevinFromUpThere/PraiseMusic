  <title>8 REST</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE Son of God, the Prince of life,
 Thrice in the garden prayed;
 The sword was drawn to pierce the One
 On whom our sins were laid.
[V2]
 He asked, if it were possible, 
 The cup might pass away;
 Made flesh for us, the Son of God 
 A prostrate suppliant lay.
[V3]
 Strong crying, tears and sweat like blood 
 Bespeak His agony,
 Yet must He sink in deeper grief
 That we might never die.
[V4]
 The sword awakened cannot rest
 Till God has slain His Son;
 The Christ must die on Golgotha
 For my sin to atone.
[V5]
 Go to Gethsemane, my soul,
 Watch with the Saviour there; 
 Ponder His pretaste of the cup,
 Then to the cross repair.
