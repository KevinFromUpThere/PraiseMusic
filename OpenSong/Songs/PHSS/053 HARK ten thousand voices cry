<title>53 RESURRECTION</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK, ten thousand voices cry,
 Victory! through the sky.
 Swiftly flies the welcome sound, Spreading rapturous joy around.
[V2]
 Jesus comes, His conflict over,
 Comes to claim His great reward; Angels round the Victor hover,
 Crowding to behold their Lord.
[V3]
 Oh, what honours.now await Him!
 Friends and foes shall hear His voice; Tremble, tremble, ye that hate Him.
 Ye who love His name rejoice.
[V4]
 Yonder throne for Him erected
 Now becomes the Victor's seat, Lo, the Man on earth rejected,
 Angels worship at His feet!
[V5]
 Day and night they cry before Him, Holy, holy, holy Lord.
 All the powers of heaven adore Him, All obey His sovereign word.
[V6]
 Then haste, ye saints, your tribute bring And laud the everlasting King;
 Laud Him,
 Laud the everlasting King.
