<lyrics>[V1]
 HAIL, Thou once despised Lord Jesus! 
 Hail, Thou still rejected King! 
 Thou didst suffer to release us,
 Thou didst free salvation bring. 
 Through Thy death and resurrection, 
 Bearer of our sin and shame,
 We enjoy divine protection,
 Life and glory through Thy name.
[V2]
 Paschal Lamb by God appointed, 
 All our sins on Thee were laid; 
 By almighty love anointed
 Thou hast full atonement made. 
 All Thy people are forgiven
 Through the virtue of Thy blood; 
 Opened now the gate of heaven, 
 Peace is made 'twixt man and God.
[V3]
 Hail, Lord Jesus, throned in glory,
 Where for us Thou dost abide; 
 All the heavenly hosts adore Thee
 Seated at Thy Father's side.
 There for us Thou now art pleading,
 There Thou dost a place prepare, 
 Ever for us interceding,
 Till in glory we appear.
[V4]
 Worship, honour, power and blessing 
 Christ is worthy to receive;
 Loudest praises without ceasing, 
 Meet it is for us to give.
 Help, ye bright angelic spirits,
 Bring your sweetest, noblest lays, 
 Help to sing the Saviour's merits, 
 Help to chant Immanuel's praise.
