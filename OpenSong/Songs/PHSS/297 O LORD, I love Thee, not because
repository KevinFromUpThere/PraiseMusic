<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, I love Thee, not because
 I hope for heaven thereby,
 Nor yet because who love Thee not
 Are lost eternally.
 Thou, O Lord Jesus, didst for me
 The shameful cross endure,
 The crown of thorns, the nails, the spear,
 The sorrows deep and sore;
[V2]
 And griefs and torments numberless, 
 And sweat of agony;
 Yea, death itself; and all for me
 Who was Thine enemy.
 Then why, O blest Lord Jesus Christ,
 Should I not love Thee well?
 Not for the hope of winning heaven,
 Nor of escaping hell;
[V3]
 Not with the hope of gaining aught, 
 Nor seeking a reward,
 But as Thyself hast loved me,
 O ever-loving Lord.
 So would I love Thee, holy Lord,
 And daily sing Thy praise,
 Solely because Thou art my God,
 Who saved me in Thy grace.
