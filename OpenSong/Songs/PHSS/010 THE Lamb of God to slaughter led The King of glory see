<lyrics>[V1]
 THE Lamb of God to slaughter led, The King of glory see,
 A crown of thorns upon His head; They nail Him to the tree.
[V2]
 The Father gives His only Son, The King of glory dies
 For us the guilty and undone, A spotless sacrifice.
[V3]
 Thy name is holy, O our God,
 Before Thy throne we bow; The holy place is our abode,
 We know Thy mercy now.
[V4]
 Enthroned with Thee now sits the Lord, And in Thy bosom dwells.
 Justice that smote Him with the sword Our perfect pardon seals.
[V5]
 Eternal death was once our doom,
 Now death has lost its sting; Triumphant through His empty tomb,
 Thy power and love we sing.
