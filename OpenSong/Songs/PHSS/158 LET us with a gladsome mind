<lyrics>[V1]
 LET us with a gladsome mind 
 Praise the Lord, for He is kind; 
 For His mercies aye endure, 
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V2]
 He, with all commanding might, 
 Filled the formless earth with light; 
 For His mercies aye endure,
 Ever faithful, ever sure. 
[V3]
 All things living He doth feed, 
 His full hand supplies their need; 
 For His mercies aye endure, 
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
[V4]
 He hath with a piteous eye 
 Looked upon our misery; 
 For His mercies aye endure, 
 Ever faithful, ever sure.
