  <title>17 HUSHED WAS THE EVENING HYMN</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 HIMSELF He could not save, 
 He on the cross must die, 
 Or mercy could not come 
 To ruined sinners nigh.
 Yes, Christ the Son of God must bleed,
 That sinners might from sin be freed.
[V2]
 Himself He could not save, 
 For justice must be done, 
 Our sins' full weight must fall 
 Upon the sinless One.
 For nothing less could God accept 
 In payment of that fearful debt.
[V3]
 Himself He could not save, 
 Love's stream too deeply flowed,
 In love Himself He gave
 To pay the debt we owed. 
 Obedience to the Father's will 
 And love to Him did all fulfil.
[V4]
 Himself He could not save,
 But now exalted high,
 A Prince and Saviour He
 Has saved and brought us nigh. 
 We live in Him who lives above,
 And sing with joy His deathless love.
