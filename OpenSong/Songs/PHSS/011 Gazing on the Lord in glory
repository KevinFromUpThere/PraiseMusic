  <lyrics>[V1]
 GAZING On the Lord in glory 
 While our hearts in worship bow, 
 There we read the wondrous story 
 Of the cross, its shame and woe.
[V2]
 Every mark of dark dishonour 
 Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow, 
 All the depths of His heart's sorrow 
 Told in answering glory now.
[V3]
 On that cross alone, forsaken,
 Where no pitying eye was found; 
 Now to God's right hand exalted
 With His praise the heavens resound.
[V4]
 Did His God e'en then forsake Him, 
 Hide Himself from His deep need?
 In that face, once marred and smitten, 
 All His glory now we read.
[V5]
 Rise, our hearts, and bless the Father; 
 Ceaseless song e'en here begun
 Endless praise and adoration
 To the Father and the Son. Amen.
