<lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET is the work, our God and King, To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing, To show Thy love by morning light,
 And tell of all Thy truth by night.
[V2]
 Our hearts shall triumph in Thee, Lord, And bless Thy works and bless Thy word; Thy works of grace, how bright they shine, How deep Thy counsels, how divine!
[V3]
 But if the little that we know
 Of Thee and Thine while here below Such triumph gives, what will it be When face to face Thyself we see?
