<title>70 PRAISE, MY SOUL</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 GLORY, glory everlasting
 Be to Him who bare the cross,
 Who redeemed our souls by tasting Death, the death deserved by us!
 Spread His glory
 Who redeemed His people thus.
[V2]
 His is love, 'tis love unbounded, Without measure, without end;
 Human thought is here confounded,
 'Tis too great to comprehend.
 Praise the Saviour,
 Magnify the sinner's Friend.
[V3]
 While we hear the wondrous story Of the Saviour's cross and shame,
 Sing we, " Everlasting glory
 Be to God and to the Lamb." Hallelujah!
 Give ye glory to His name.
