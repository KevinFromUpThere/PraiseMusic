  <title>70 PRAISE, MY SOUL</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 GLORY, glory everlasting
 Be to Him who bare the cross,
 Who redeemed our souls by tasting 
 Death, the death deserved by us!
 Spread His glory, spread his glory,
 Who redeemed His people thus.
[V2]
 His is love, 'tis love unbounded, 
 Without measure, without end;
 Human thought is here confounded,
 'Tis too great to comprehend.
 Praise the Saviour,praise the Saviour,
 Magnify the sinner's Friend.
[V3]
 While we hear the wondrous story 
 Of the Saviour's cross and shame,
 Sing we, "Everlasting glory
 Be to God and to the Lamb." 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 Give ye glory to His name.
