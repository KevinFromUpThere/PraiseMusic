<lyrics>[V1]
 SOVEREIGN grace o'er sin abounding,
 Ransomed souls the tidings swell; 'Tis a deep that knows no sounding,
 Who its breadth or length can tell?
 On its glories
 Let our souls for ever dwell.
[V2]
 What from Christ the soul can sever, Bound by everlasting bands?
 Once in Him, in Him for everï¿½Thus th' eternal covenant stands. None can pluck us
 From the Strength of Israel's hands.
[V3]
 Love eternal in Christ chose us,
 Long ere time its race began.
 Wealth of heavenly blessing shows us What the love of God has done; With Christ Jesus,
 By eternal union one.
[V4]
 On such love let us still ponder,
 Love so great, so rich, so free; Say, while lost in holy wonder,
 "Why are we, Lord, loved by Thee?" Hallelujah!
 Grace shall reign eternally.
