 304 PALMS OF GLORY
 SWEETER sounds than music knows 
 Charm me in Immanuel's name; 
 All her hopes my spirit owes
 To His birth and cross and shame.
[V2]
 When He came, the heavenly host 
 Glory gave to God on high;
 Lord, my tongue should praise Thee most, 
 Who should louder sing than I?
[V3]
 Did the Lord a man become, 
 That He might the law fulfil, 
 Bleed and suffer in my room, 
 And canst thou, my tongue, be still?
[V4]
 No, I must my praises bring, 
 Though they feeble are and weak; 
 For should I refuse to sing,
 Sure the very stones would speak.
[V5]
 O my Saviour, Shield, and Sun,
 Rock and Tower, Shepherd, Friend, 
 Every precious name in one,
 Love I owe Thee without end.
[V12]
 Christ and His Church
