 244 JOY IN SORROW
 I'VE found a joy in sorrow, 
 A secret balm for pain, 
 A beautiful tomorrow
 Of sunshine after rain;
 I've found a branch of healing
 Near every bitter spring,
 A whispered promise stealing
 O'er every broken string.
[V2]
 I've found a glad hosanna
 For every woe and wail, 
 A handful of sweet manna
 When grapes of Eshcol fail;
 I've found a Rock of ages
 When desert wells are dry, 
 And after weary stages
 I've found an Elim nigh;
[V3]
 An Elim with its coolness,
 Its fountains and its shade; 
 A blessing in its fulness,
 When buds of promise fade. 
 O'er tears of sweet contrition
 I've seen a rainbow light, 
 A glory and fruition,
 So near though out of sight.
[V4]
 Lord Jesus, Thee possessing,
 I have the joy, the balm,
 The healing and the blessing,
 The sunshine and the psalm, 
 The promise for the fearful, 
 The Elim for the faint,
 The rainbow for the tearful,
 The glory for the saint.
