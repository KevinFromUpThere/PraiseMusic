<lyrics>[V1]
 How perfect our salvation
 Through Him who bore the shame. 
 We're free from condemnation;
 Sin offering He became. 
 We are a holy nation,
 And come in His blest name 
 To offer our oblation,
 To celebrate His fame.
[V2]
 Each Lordly morn confessing
 The One who bore our blame, 
 Such wealth in Him possessing,
 His matchless worth acclaim. 
 Yet week-day griefs oppressing,
 With many a weary care,
 Oft trials so hard, distressing,
 Near drive us to despair.
[V3]
 But aye let us endeavour
 To go to God in prayer, 
 For sure no trial can sever
 Our spirits from His care. 
 Our hardest path is never
 So hard as that He trod, 
 Who day by day is ever
 Just leading us to God.
[V4]
 Then sing we our salvation
 As patiently we plod,
 Resisting all temptation,
 Nor fainting 'neath the rod.
 With peaceful preparation 
 For gospel message shod,
 We'll seek Christ's approbation,
 And tread the path he trod.
