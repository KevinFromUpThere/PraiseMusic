  <lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET is the savour of His name 
 Who suffered in His people's stead; 
 His portion here reproach and shame, 
 He liveth now, He once was dead.
[V2]
 He once was dead, the very same 
 Who sits on yonder throne above, 
 Who bears in heaven the greatest name, 
 Whom angels serve, whom angels love.
[V3]
 He once was dead, the very same 
 Who made the worlds, a work of power, 
 Who now upholds the mighty frame, 
 And keeps it till the final hour.
[V4]
 He once was dead; but now He lives, 
 His glory fills all heaven above;
 Its blessedness to heaven He gives, 
 The fountain He of joy and love.
[V5]
 His people shall His triumph share, 
 With Him shall live and with Him reign, 
 In heaven their joy is full, for there 
 They see Him who for them was slain.
 
[V1]
 LET us join our God to bless 
 For His Son our righteousness,
 Him who bowed His head so low 
 Underneath our load of woe.
[V2]
 His the curse, the wounds, the gall, 
 His the stripes, He bore them all; 
 His the dying cry of pain
 When our sins He did sustain.
[V3]
 He, the accepted sacrifice,
 From the vanquished grave did rise. 
 Free Himself, He set us free
 In His perfect liberty.
[V4]
 Praise our God who willed it thus, 
 Praise His Son who died for us, 
 Praise the Father for the Son
 Who so vast a work hath done.
