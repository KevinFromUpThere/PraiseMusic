  <lyrics>[V1]
 SWEET is the savour of His name 
 Who suffered in His people's stead; 
 His portion here reproach and shame, 
 He liveth now, He once was dead.
[V2]
 He once was dead, the very same 
 Who sits on yonder throne above, 
 Who bears in heaven the greatest name, 
 Whom angels serve, whom angels love.
[V3]
 He once was dead, the very same 
 Who made the worlds, a work of power, 
 Who now upholds the mighty frame, 
 And keeps it till the final hour.
[V4]
 He once was dead; but now He lives, 
 His glory fills all heaven above;
 Its blessedness to heaven He gives, 
 The fountain He of joy and love.
[V5]
 His people shall His triumph share, 
 With Him shall live and with Him reign, 
 In heaven their joy is full, for there 
 They see Him who for them was slain.
