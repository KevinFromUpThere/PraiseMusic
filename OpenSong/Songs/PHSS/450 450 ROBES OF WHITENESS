  <title>450 ROBES OF WHITENESS</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 OH, for the robes of whiteness!
 Oh, for the tearless eyes!
 Oh, for the glorious brightness
 Of the unclouded skies!
 Oh, for the no more weeping
 Within the land of love; 
 The endless joy of keeping
 The bridal feast above!
[V2]
 Oh, for the bliss of rising,
 My coming Lord to meet! 
 Oh, for the rest of lying
 For ever at His feet!
 Oh, for the hour of seeing
 My Saviour face to face; 
 The hope of ever being
 In that sweet resting-place!
[V3]
 Lord Jesus, King of glory,
 I soon shall dwell with Thee. 
 I soon shall sing the story
 Of Thy great love to me. 
 Meanwhile my thoughts would enter,
 E'en now before Thy throne, 
 That all my love might centre
 On Thee, and Thee alone.
