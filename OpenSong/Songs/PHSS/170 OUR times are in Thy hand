<lyrics>[V1]
 OUR times are in Thy hand. 
 O God, we wish them there;
 Our lives, our souls, our all, we leave 
 Entirely to Thy care.
 Our times are in Thy hand, 
 Whatever they may be;
 Pleasing or 'painful, dark or bright,
 As best may seem to Thee.
[V2]
 Our times are in Thy hand. 
 Why should we doubt or fear?
 Our Father's hand will never cause
 His child a needless tear.
 Our times are in Thy hand, 
 Jesus, the Crucified;
 The hand our many sins have pierced
 Is now our guard and guide.
[V3]
 Our times are in Thy hand, 
 Jesus, the Advocate.
 Nor can that hand be stretched in vain, 
 For us to supplicate.
 Our times are in Thy hand; 
 We'd always trust in Thee,
 Till we, in yonder heavenly land, 
 Thyself in glory see.
