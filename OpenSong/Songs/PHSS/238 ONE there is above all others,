<lyrics>[V1]
 ONE there is above all others,
 Oh how He loves! 
 His is love beyond a brother's,
 Oh how He loves! 
 Earthly friends may fail or leave us, 
 One day soothe, the next day grieve us, 
 But this Friend will ne'er deceive us;
 Oh how He loves!
[V2]
 'Tis eternal life to know Him,
 Oh how He loves! 
 Think, oh think how much we owe Him,
 Oh, how He loves!
 With His precious blood He bought us, 
 In the wilderness He sought us,
 To His fold He safely brought us;
 Oh how He loves!
[V3]
 What a Friend is our Lord Jesus,
 Oh how He loves! 
 'Tis His great delight to bless us,
 Oh how He loves! 
 How our hearts delight to hear Him 
 Bid us dwell in safety near Him!
 Why should we distrust or fear Him?
 Oh how He loves!
[V4]
 Through His name we are forgiven,
 Oh how He loves!
 Backward shall our foes be driven,
 Oh how He loves!
 Best of blessings He'll provide us,
 Nought but good shall e'er betide us, 
 Safe to glory He will guide us,
 Oh how He loves!
