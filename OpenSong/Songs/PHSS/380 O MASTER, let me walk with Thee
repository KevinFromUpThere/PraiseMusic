<lyrics>[V1]
 O MASTER, let me walk with Thee 
 In lowly paths of service free; 
 Tell me Thy secret; help me bear 
 The strain of toil, the fret of care.
[V2]
 Help me the slow of heart to move 
 By some clear, winning word of love; 
 Teach me the wayward feet to stay, 
 And guide them in the homeward way.
[V3]
 Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee 
 In closer, dearer company;
 In work that keeps faith sweet and strong, 
 In trust that triumphs over wrong;
[V4]
 In hope that sends a shining ray
 Far down the future's broadening way;
 In peace that only Thou canst give, 
 With Thee, O Master, let me live.
