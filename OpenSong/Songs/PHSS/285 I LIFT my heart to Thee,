<lyrics>[V1]
 I LIFT my heart to Thee,
 Saviour divine;
 For Thou art all to me,
 And I am Thine.
 Is there on earth a closer bond than this—
 That my Beloved's mine, and I am His?
[V2]
 Thine am I by all ties; 
 But chiefly Thine,
 That through Thy sacrifice 
 Thou, Lord, art mine.
 By Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound
 Around me, I to Thee am closely bound.
[V3]
 To Thee, Thou dying Lamb,
 I all things owe;
 All that I have and am,
 And all I know.
 All that I have is now no longer mine,
 And I am not my own; Lord, I am Thine.
[V4]
 How can I, Lord, withhold
 Life's brightest hour
 From Thee; or gathered gold,
 Or any power?
 Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee, 
 When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me?
