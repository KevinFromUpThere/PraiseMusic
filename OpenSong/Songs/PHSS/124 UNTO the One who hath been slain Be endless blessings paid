<lyrics>[V1]
 UNTO the One who hath been slain Be endless blessings paid.
 Salvation, glory, joy remain
 For ever on His head.
 He hath redeemed us with His blood, Hath set the prisoners free,
 And we will praise His name, O God, To all eternity. Amen.
 ON earth the song begins,
 In heaven more sweet and loud; To Him who cleansed our sins By His atoning blood,
 To Him (we sing in joyful strain)
 Be honour, power and praise; Amen.
[V2]
 Alone He bare the cross,
 Alone its grief sustained;
 His was the shame and loss,
 And He the victory gained.
 The mighty work was all His own, Though we shall share His glorious throne.
[V3]
 To Him who bare the cross, Its awful load sustained,
 Who suffered shame and loss,
 And the great victory gained, To Him (we sing in joyful strain) Be honour, power and praise; Amen.
