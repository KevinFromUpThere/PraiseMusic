<lyrics>[V1]
 GLORIOUS things of thee are spoken,
 Heavenly city of our God;
 He, whose word can ne'er be broken,
 Formed thee for His own abode. 
 On the rock of ages founded,
 What can shake thy sure repose? 
 With salvation's walls surrounded,
 Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.
[V2]
 See the streams of living waters,
 Springing from eternal love,
 Flow to cheer thy sons and daughters,
 And all fear of want remove.
 Who can faint where such a river
 Freely flows their thirst t'assuage, 
 Blessings which, like God the Giver,
 Never fail from age to age?
[V3]
 Round each habitation hovering, 
 See the cloud and fire appear 
 For a glory and a covering,
 Showing that the Lord is there.
 He who gives the daily manna,
 He who listens to their cry,
 Let Him hear the loud Hosanna 
 Rising to His throne on high.
[V4]
 Let the world deride or pity,
 We may well endure the shame, 
 Since, O Lord, in that blest city 
 Thou hast record of our name. 
 Fading is the sinner's pleasure,
 All his boasted pomp and show. 
 Solid joy and lasting treasure
 None but God's own children know.
