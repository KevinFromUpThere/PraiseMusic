<lyrics>[V1]
 FIGHT the good fight with all thy might; 
 Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right. 
 Lay hold on life, and it shall be
 Thy joy and crown eternally.
[V2]
 Run the straight race, through God's good grace;
 Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face. 
 Life with its path before thee lies,
 Christ is the way and Christ the prize.
[V3]
 Cast care aside, upon thy Guide
 Lean, and His mercy will provide. 
 Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove 
 Christ is its life and Christ its love.
[V4]
 Faint not nor fear, His arm is near;
 He changeth not, and thou art dear. 
 Only believe, thou soon shalt see 
 Christ who is all in all to thee.
