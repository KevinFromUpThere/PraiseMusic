<lyrics>[V1]
 TAKE up thy cross, the Saviour said,
 If thou wouldst My disciple be;
 Take up thy cross, with willing heart,
 And humbly follow after Me.
[V2]
 Take up thy cross; let not its weight
 Fill thy weak soul with vain alarm; 
 His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
 And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm.
[V3]
 Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame, 
 Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
 The Lord for thee the cross endured
 To save thy soul from death and hell.
[V4]
 Take up thy cross, and follow Christ, 
 Nor think till death to lay it down; 
 For only he who bears the cross
 May hope to wear the glorious crown.
