<lyrics>[V1]
 RIDE on, ride on, in majesty;
 Hark! all the tribes " Hosanna " cry. 
 O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road 
 With palms and scattered garments strewed.
 Ride on, ride on, in majesty, 
 In lowly pomp ride on to die.
[V2]
 Ride on, ride on, in majesty;
 The angel armies of the sky
 Look down with sad and wondering eyes, 
 To see th'approaching sacrifice.
[V3]
 Ride on, ride on, in majesty;
 The last and fiercest strife is nigh; 
 The Father on His sapphire throne 
 Awaits His own anointed Son.
[V4]
 Ride on, ride on, in majesty,
 In lowly pomp ride on to die;
 Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain, 
 Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign.
