<lyrics>[V1]
 IN the Christian's home in glory
 There remains a land of rest,
 Where the Saviour's gone before me 
 To fulfil my soul's request.
 He is fitting up my mansion, 
 Which eternally shall stand;
 For my stay will not be transient 
 In that holy, happy land.
[V2]
 Pain or sickness ne'er can enter, 
 Grief nor woe my lot shall share; 
 But in that celestial centre
 I a crown of life shall wear.
 Death itself has now been vanquished,
 And its sting has been withdrawn.
 Shout with gladness, O ye ransomed,
 Hail with joy the happy morn.
[V3]
 Sing, oh sing, ye heirs of glory!
 Shout your triumphs as ye go! 
 Zion's gates will open to you,
 You shall find an entrance through. 
 Hallelujah! Christ is coming;
 He will take His people home.
 Quickly come, Lord Jesus, Saviour;
 Blessed Master, quickly come!
