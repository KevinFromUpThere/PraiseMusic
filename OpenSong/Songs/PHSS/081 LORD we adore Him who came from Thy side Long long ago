<title>81 it WONDERFUL LOVE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD, we adore Him who came from Thy side Long, long ago,
 Leaving the glory that heaven could provide, Coming to suffering and woe.
 Jesus our Lordï¿½
 Wonderful gift of the Father of love.
[V2]
 We will remember Him, keeping His word" This must ye do;"
 Gladly discerning His body, O Lord,
 Taught by the Spirit 'tis true.
 Jesus our Lordï¿½
 Sacrificed, bearing our sins on the tree.
[V3]
 We will remember His coming to earth, Immanuel!
 There as a Babe we behold Him at birth, God in this world here to dwell.
 Jesus our Lordï¿½
 Laid in a manger, eternally God!
[V4]
 We will remember His wonderful life, Doing Thy will.
 Perfect obedience midst sorrow and strife
 Led Him to Calvary's hill.
 Jesus our Lord
 Loving and giving each step of the way.
[V5]
 We will remember His death on the tree, Blest be His name!
 Suffering the just for the unjust was He; 'Twas for this purpose He came.
 Jesus our Lord
 Giving Himself, our Redeemer to be.
[V6]
 We will remember He rose from the dead, Mighty to save.
 Living for ever, our glorious Head
 Conquered the power of the grave.
 Jesus our Lord
 Praises for Him we present unto Thee.
