<lyrics>[V1]
 'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow 
 The star is dimmed that lately shone; 
 'Tis midnight in the garden now,
 The suffering Saviour prays alone.
[V2]
 'Tis midnight, and from all removed 
 The Saviour wrestles 'lone with fears; 
 E'en that disciple whom He loved 
 Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.
[V3]
 'Tis midnight, agonized He kneels,
 The sweat falls down like drops of blood; 
 Yet He who such deep anguish feels
 Is not forsaken by His God.
[V4]
 'Tis midnight, but before Him loom 
 Yet darker hours of deeper woe; 
 Golgotha's anguish, death, the tomb, 
 The patient Saviour needs must know.
[V5]
 O God, those midnight scenes of woe In tenderest memory we recall;
 We bless the One who loved us so, And fully own that Christ is all.
