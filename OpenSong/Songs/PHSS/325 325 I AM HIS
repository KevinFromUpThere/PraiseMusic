<title>325 I AM HIS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 325 I AM HIS
 LOVED with everlasting love,
 Led by grace that love to know; 
 Spirit, breathing from above,
 Thou hast taught me it is so. 
 Oh, this full and perfect peace!
 Oh, this transport all divine! 
 In a love which cannot cease
 I am His and He is mine.
[V2]
 Heaven above is softer blue,
 Earth around is sweeter green; 
 Something lives in every hue
 Christless eyes have never seen; 
 Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,
 Flowers with deeper beauties shine, 
 Since I know as now I know,
 I am His and He is mine.
[V3]
 His for ever, only His;
 Who the Lord and me shall part? 
 Oh, with what a rest of bliss
 Christ can fill the loving heart! 
 Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
 First-born light in gloom decline;
 I with God shall ever be,
 I am His and He is mine.
