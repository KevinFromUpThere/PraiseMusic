 254 I'VE FOUND A FRIEND
 I'VE found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
 He loved me ere I knew Him;
 He drew me with the cords of love,
 And thus He bound me to Him.
 And round my heart still closely twine
 Those ties which nought can sever; 
 For I am His and He is mine,
 For ever and for ever.
[V2]
 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! 
 He bled, He died to save me;
 And not alone the gift of life,
 But His own self He gave me. 
 Nought that I have mine own I'd call, 
 I hold it for the Giver;
 My heart, my strength, my life, my all, 
 Are His, and His for ever.
[V3]
 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
 All power to Him is given,
 To guard me on my onward course
 And bring me safe to heaven. 
 Th'eternal glories gleam afar
 To nerve my faint endeavour;
 So now to watch, to work, to war,
 And then, to rest for ever.
[V4]
 I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
 So kind, and true, and tender; 
 So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
 So mighty a Defender!
 From Him, who loves me now so well,
 What power my soul shall sever?
 Shall life or death? Shall earth or hell?
 No, I am His for ever.
