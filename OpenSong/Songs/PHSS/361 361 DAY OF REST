 361 DAY OF REST
 LORD JESUS, 'tis my purpose
 To serve Thee to the end; 
 Be Thou for ever near me,
 My Master and my Friend.
 I shall not fear the battle
 If Thou art by my side,
 Nor wander from the pathway
 If Thou wilt be my Guide.
[V2]
 Oh, let me know Thee near me; 
 The world is ever near ;
 I see the sights that dazzle,
 The tempting sounds I hear. 
 My foes are ever near me,
 Around me and within;
 Lord Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
 And shield my soul from sin.
[V3]
 Oh, let me hear Thee speaking
 In accents clear and still,
 Above the storms of passion,
 The murmurs of self-will. 
 Oh, speak to reassure me,
 To hasten or control;
 Oh, speak and make me listen, 
 Thou Guardian of my soul.
[V4]
 Lord Jesus, Thou hast promised
 To all who follow Thee,
 That where Thou art in glory,
 There shall Thy servant be. 
 Lord Jesus, 'tis my purpose
 To serve Thee to the end; 
 Oh, give me grace to follow,
 My Master and my Friend.
[V5]
 Oh, let me see Thy footmarks, 
 And in them plant mine own. 
 My hope to follow duly
 Is in Thy strength alone;
 Oh guide me, call me, draw me,
 Uphold me to the end,
 And then in heaven receive me,
 My Saviour and my Friend.
