<lyrics>[V1]
 LORD Jesus Christ, the thought of Thee 
 With sweetness fills my breast;
 But better far Thy face to see,
 And in Thy presence rest.
[V2]
 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, 
 Nor can the memory find
 A sweeter sound than Thy blest name, 
 O Saviour of mankind.
[V3]
 O Hope of every contrite heart,
 Thou joy of all the meek,
 To those who fall how kind Thou art, 
 How good to those who seek!
[V4]
 But what to those who find! Ah, this 
 Nor tongue, nor pen can show; 
 Thy love, Lord Jesus, what it is
 None but Thy loved ones know.
[V5]
 Our only joy and strength be Thou,
 As Thou our crown wilt be;
 Be Thou, O Lord, our glory now
 And through eternity. Amen.
