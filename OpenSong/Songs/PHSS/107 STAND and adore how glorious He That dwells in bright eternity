<title>107 HOLLEY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 STAND and adore! how glorious He That dwells in bright eternity;
 We gaze and we confound our sight, Plunged in th' abyss of dazzling light.
[V2]
 Thou Sacred One, Almighty Three, Great everlasting mystery,
 What lofty numbers shall we frame, Equal to Thy tremendous name?
[V3]
 Seraphs that stand around the throne Begin and speak the great Unknown; Attempt the song, wind up your strings To notes untried and boundless things.
[V4]
 Ye whose capacious powers survey Largely beyond our eyes of clay, Yet what a narrow portion too
 Is seen, or known, or thought by you!
[V5]
 How flat your highest praises fall Below th' immense Original!
 Weak creatures we that strive in vain To reach an uncreated strain!
[V6]
 Great God, forgive our feeble lays, Sound out Thine own eternal praise; A song so vast, a theme so high,
 Calls for the voice that tuned the sky.
