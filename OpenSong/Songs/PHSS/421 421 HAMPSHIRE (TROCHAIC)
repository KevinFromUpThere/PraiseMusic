 421 HAMPSHIRE (TROCHAIC)
 OUR Lord's coming draweth nigh,
 His long-sought unveiling;
 Let us Maranatha cry
 With a faith unfailing.
 At the moment of His choice,
 God's great might displaying, He will make His saints rejoice;
 Christ is not delaying. 
[V2]
 From the realms of perfect day
 Nought shall ever take us;
 God shall wipe all tears away,
 And will not forsake us.
 But of all the wealth of bliss
 Which Christ's poorness brought us, 
 We shall treasure none like this-
 'Twas Himself that bought us.
[V3]
 Blessedness of home at last,
 There to be for ever;
 Blessedness of sorrows past, 
 Past all stern endeavour.
 For such blessedness prepare 
 What our Master loveth 
 Gold and gems and treasure rare; 
 All our work He proveth.	
[V4]
 Life's last thread may soon be spun, 
 Fleeting tasks be ended;
 This our web of service done,
 Our days here expended;
 But within the courts above,
 With abiding pleasure,
 We shall serve Him whom we love, 
 Without stint or measure.
[V5]
 Gathering cloud and threat of sea
 Home the traveller urges; 
 We would to the haven flee,
 Where storm no more surges. 
 In our hearts the breaking dawn
 Hope anew awakens,
 And the day-star with the morn 
 Entrance sure betokens.
