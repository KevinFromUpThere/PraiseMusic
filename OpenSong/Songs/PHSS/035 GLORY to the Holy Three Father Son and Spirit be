<title>We praise Thy name. 35 HARTS</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 GLORY to the Holy Three, Father, Son and Spirit be;
 Him who gave, and Him who died, Him who with us doth abide.
[V2]
 Glory be to Him who gave
 His own Son our souls to save, Sent Him down from heaven above To reveal His Father's love.
[V3]
 Glory to th' incarnate Word.
 Our all-worthy Kinsman, Lord; Lord of earth and Lord of heaven, Who for us His life hath given.
[V4]
 Glory to the Spirit pure,
 He doth to our hearts make sure All the goodness of our God, All the worth of Jesus' blood.
[V5]
 Love of Father, love of Son, Love of aye-abiding One;
 Glory, honour. worship be
 To the undivided Three. Amen.
 JOHN J
