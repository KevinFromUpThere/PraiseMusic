<lyrics>[V1]
 WHAT will it be to dwell above,
 And with the Lord of glory reign, 
 Since the sweet earnest of His love 
 So brightens all this dreary plain!
 No heart can think, no tongue explain, 
 What joy 'twill be with Christ to reign.
[V2]
 When sin no more obstructs our sight, 
 When sorrow pains the heart no more; 
 When we shall see the Prince of light, 
 And all His works of grace explore; 
 What heights and depths of love divine 
 Will there through endless ages shine!
[V3]
 And God has fixed the happy day 
 When the last tear shall dim our eyes; 
 When He will wipe all tears away 
 And fill our hearts with glad surprise, 
 To hear His voice, to see His face, 
 And know the riches of His grace.
[V4]
 This is the joy we seek to know,
 For this with patience we would wait; 
 Till, called from earth and all below, 
 We rise, our gracious Lord to meet, 
 His home for evermore to share,
 And praise the love that brought us there.
