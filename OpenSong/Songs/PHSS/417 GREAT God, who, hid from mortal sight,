<lyrics>[V1]
 GREAT God, who, hid from mortal sight, 
 Dost dwell in unapproached light, 
 Before whose presence angels bow,
 With faces veiled, in homage low;
[V2]
 Awhile in darkness we remain,
 And round us yet are sin and pain; 
 But soon the everlasting day
 Shall chase our shades of night away.
[V3]
 For Thou hast promised, gracious Lord, 
 A day of gladness and reward,
 A day but faintly imaged here
 By brightest sun at noontide clear.
[V4]
 When Christ shall come to set us free, 
 He'll bring us in, O God, to Thee;
 To see Thee, love Thee and adore, 
 Our blissful task for evermore.
[V5]
 While here below our hearts prepare 
 The fulness of Thy joy to share, 
 Life's transient light may we improve. 
 Till Christ shall take us up above.
