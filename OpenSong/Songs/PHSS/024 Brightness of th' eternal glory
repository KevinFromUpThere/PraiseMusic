  <title>24 LUCERNE</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BRIGHTNESS of th' eternal glory
 Shall His praise unuttered lie?
 Who would hush the heaven-sent story
 Of the One who came to die?
[V2]
 Came from Godhead's fullest glory
 Down to Calvary's depth of woe; 
 Now on high, we bow before Him,
 Streams of praises ceaseless flow.
[V3]
 Sing His blest triumphant rising,
 He is on the Father's throne;
 Sing till heaven and earth surprising
 He shall reign and He alone.
