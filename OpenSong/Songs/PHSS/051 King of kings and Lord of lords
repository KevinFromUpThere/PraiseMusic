  <lyrics>[V1]
 KING of kings and Lord of lords
 These great awe-inspiring words 
 Unto Christ the Lord belong;
 Let His people raise their song.
[V2]
 Glory, honour, praise and power, 
 These are His for evermore.
 He is on the throne above,
 Jesus, who told out God's love.
[V3]
 Holy, holy, holy Lord,
 Heaven and earth His name record.
 Power and praise to Him belong, 
 "He is worthy," is our song.
[V4]
 Rich in glory, Christ did stoop, 
 Thence is all His people's hope. 
 He was poor that we might be 
 Rich with Him eternally.
[V5]
 When we think of love like this,
 Joy and shame our hearts possess;
 Joy that he could pity thus,
 Shame for such return from us. 
[V6]
 Yet we soon the day shall see 
 When we shall from sin be free, 
 Borne aloft, to heaven brought, 
 There to praise God as we ought.
