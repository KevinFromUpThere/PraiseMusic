<lyrics>[V1]
 276 . FLAVIAN 
 WALK in the light, so shalt thou know 
 That fellowship of love
 His Spirit only can bestow,
 Who reigns in light above.
[V2]
 Walk in the light, and thou shalt find 
 Thy heart made truly His,
 Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined, 
 In whom no darkness is.
[V3]
 Walk in the light, o'er sin abhorred
 Thou shalt the victory gain;
 The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
 Shall cleanse from every stain.
[V4]
 Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb 
 No fearful shade shall wear;
 Glory shall chase away its gloom, 
 For Christ hath conquered there.
[V5]
 Walk in the light, and thou shalt own 
 Thy darkness passed away,
 Because that light hath on thee shone 
 In which is perfect day.
[V6]
 Walk in the light, thy path shall be
 Steadfast, serene, and bright;
 For God in grace shall dwell in thee,
 And God Himself is light.
