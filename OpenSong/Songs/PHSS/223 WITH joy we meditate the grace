<lyrics>[V1]
 WITH joy we meditate the grace
 Of our High Priest above;
 His heart is filled with tenderness,
 His very name is Love.
[V2]
 Touched with a sympathy within,
 He knows our feeble frame;
 He knows what sore temptations are,
 For He has felt the same.
[V3]
 But spotless, undefiled and pure,
 Our great Redeemer stood;
 While Satan's fiery darts He bore,
 And did resist to blood.
[V4]
 He in the days of lowly flesh
 Poured out His cries and tears; 
 And, though exalted, feels afresh
 What every member bears.
[V5]
 Then boldly let our faith address
 His mercy and His power;
 We shall obtain delivering grace
 In each distressing hour.
