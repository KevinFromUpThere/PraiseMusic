  <title>6 ST. ALPHEGE</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 SENT from th' eternal Father
 Who dwells in light above,
 Came forth the Son most holy 
 To manifest His love.
[V2]
 This is the wondrous story
 Born of a Hebrew maid 
 The Lord of life and glory;
 And in a manger laid.
[V3]
 He grew in human stature,
 In every childlike grace; 
 He lived a life most holy
 In all His youthful days;
[V4]
 Attaining manhood's ripeness,
 Midst sinners sinless He;
 And though in human likeness,
 From human errors free.
[V5]
 He entered on His life-work, 
 Approved by God Most High; 
 When tempted in the desert
 He made the Tempter fly.
[V6]
 In Galilee behold Him
 A simple wedding-guest,
 But mighty powers enfold Him, 
 Believing ones are blest.
[V7]
 Through this dark vale of sorrow
 He, clothed with pity, went. 
 In Him each sick and sad one
 Found power and mercy blent.
[V8]
 But looming black before Him
 See His dread cross appear; 
 Oh, well may we adore Him,
 He bore our sorrows there!
[V9]
 Then glory to the Father,
 For us His Son He gave;
 To Christ, Kinsman-Redeemer,
 He died our souls to save;
 [V10]
 To God th' eternal Spirit,
 'Tis He reveals the Son; 
 We praise Thy holy merit,
 Jehovah, Three in One.
