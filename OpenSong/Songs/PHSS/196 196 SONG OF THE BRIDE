 196 SONG OF THE BRIDE
 FEAR thou not, for He is with thee;
 Be thou not dismayed.
 Look to Him, He'll guide and shield thee;
 Do not be afraid.
 When temptations round thee gather
 And thy strength seems small, 
 Look above to God, thy Helper; 
 Find in Him thine all.
[V2]
 He has promised to be with thee,
 Hold thee by thy hand;
 Why not then go forth with courage
 At thy Lord's command? 
 Knowing that the way He leadeth
 Must be always best,
 Fear thou not, and do not falter;
 On His promise rest.
[V3]
 Cast on Him thine every burden,
 Whatsoe'er it be;
 Hear His voice unto thee saying,
 "Cast thy care on Me."
 He has said, "I'll never leave thee,
 Never thee forsake;"
 Cast then all thy care upon Him,
 And fresh courage take.
