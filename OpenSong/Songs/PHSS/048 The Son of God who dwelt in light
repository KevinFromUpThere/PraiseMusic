  <title>48 SOUTHWELL</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 THE Son of God, who dwelt in light 
 Unreached by mortal eye,
 Came forth as man the foe to fight, 
 And won the victory.
[V2]
 In perfect light was sin made bare, 
 It met its utmost due;
 While perfect love in triumph there 
 Revealed salvation too.
[V3] 
 Who but the sinless One could be
 Sin-offering meet for God?
 And who in heaven or earth save He 
 Could cleanse us with His blood?
[V4]
 Exalted now at God's right hand
 He sits enthroned above;
 Eternal proof that God is just, 
 And proof that God is love.
