<title>343 MARCHING</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 FROM the cross unto the glory,
 Through the darksome vale of tears; 
 Trusting, serving and obeying,
 It may be for days or years.
[V2]
 From the cross unto the glory,
 With the Saviour nigh at hand; 
 Sooner, later, all arriving
 In the pleasant promised land.
[V3]
 From the cross unto the glory,
 With a happy pilgrim band;
 Bright or cloudy be the pathway,
 By His grace we soon shall land.
[V4]
 To the cross down from the glory,
 First He came to set us free; 
 Soon He comes, and raised in glory 
 We shall ever with Him be.
[V5]
 From the cross unto the glory,
 Him as Lord I gladly own;
 Telling all the wondrous story
 Of the One who wears the crown.
