 441 SILVER CORD
 SOME day the silver cord will break,
 And I no more as now shall sing; 
 But oh, the joy when I shall wake
 Within the palace of the King!
 And I shall see Him face to face, 
 And tell the story—Saved by grace!
[V2]
 Some day my earthly house will fall,
 I cannot tell how soon 'twill be; 
 But this I know, my All-in-all
 Has now a place in heaven for me.
[V3]
 Some day! Till then I'll watch and wait,
 My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, 
 That when my Saviour opes the gate,
 My soul to Him may take its flight.
