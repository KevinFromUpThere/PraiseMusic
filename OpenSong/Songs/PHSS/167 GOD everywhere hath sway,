<lyrics>[V1]
 GOD everywhere hath sway, 
 And all things serve His might;
 His every act pure blessing is,
 His path unsullied light.
[V2]
 He hath made bare His arm. 
 Who shall His work withstand'
 'Tis He His people's cause defends,
 Who then shall stay His hand?
[V3]
 We comprehend Him not
 Yet earth and heaven tell.
 God sits as Sovereign on the throne, 
 And ruleth all things well.
