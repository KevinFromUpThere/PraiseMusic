<lyrics>[V1]
 WHAT grace, O Lord, and beauty shone 
 Around Thy steps below!
 What patient love was seen in all
 Thy life and death of woe!
[V2]
 For ever on Thy burdened heart
 A weight of sorrow hung;
 Yet no ungentle, murmuring word 
 Escaped Thy silent tongue.
[V3]
 Thy foes might hate, despise, revile,
 Thy friends unfaithful prove;
 Unwearied in forgiveness still,
 Thy heart could only love.
[V4]
 Oh, give us hearts to love like Thee,
 Like Thee, O Lord, to grieve
 Far more for others' sins, than all
 The wrongs that we receive.
[V5]
 One with Thyself, may every eye 
 In us, Thy brethren, see
 That gentleness and grace that spring
 From union, Lord, with Thee.
