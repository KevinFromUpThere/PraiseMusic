 249 IT PASSETH KNOWLEDGE
 It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine 
 Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length, 
 Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
 Know more and more.
[V2]
 It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine 
 Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near, 
 A love which can remove all guilty fear,
 And love beget.
[V3]
 It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet this heart of mine 
 Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free, 
 Which brings a rebel sinner, even me,
 Nigh unto God.
[V4]
 But though I cannot sing or tell or know
 The fulness of Thy love while here below, 
 My empty vessel I may freely bring;
 O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
 My vessel fill!
[V5]
 Oh, fill me, holy Saviour, with Thy love; 
 Lead, lead me to the living fount above. 
 Thither may I in simple faith draw nigh, 
 And never to another fountain fly,
 But unto Thee.
[V6]
 And when, Lord Jesus, Thine own face I see, 
 When at Thy lofty throne I bow the knee, 
 Then of Thy love in all its breadth and length, 
 Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
 My soul shall sing.
