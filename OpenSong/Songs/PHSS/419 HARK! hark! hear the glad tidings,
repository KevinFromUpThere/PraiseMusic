<lyrics>[V1]
 HARK! hark! hear the glad tidings,
 Soon, soon will the Lord come, 
 Robed, robed in honour and glory, 
 To gather His ransomed ones home;
 Yes, yes, oh yes!
 To gather His ransomed ones home.
[V2]
 Joy! joy! sound it more loudly,
 Sing, sing glory to God; 
 Soon, soon is the Lord coming; 
 Publish the tidings abroad.
 Yes, yes, oh yes!
 Publish the tidings abroad.
[V3]
 Now, now through a glass darkly
 Shine, shine visions to come; 
 Soon, soon we shall behold Him 
 Cloudless and bright in our home;
 Yes, yes, oh yes!
 Cloudless and bright in our home.
[V4]
 Long, long have we been waiting, 
 Who, who love His blest name;
  Now, now we are delighting,
 The Lord's drawing near to proclaim. 
 Yes, yes, oh yes!
 The Lord's drawing near to proclaim.
[V5]
 Still, still rest on His promise,
 Cling, cling fast to His word, 
 Wait, wait, He will not tarry, 
 We'll patiently wait for the Lord.
 Yes, yes, oh yes!
 We'll patiently wait for the Lord.
