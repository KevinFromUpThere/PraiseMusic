<title>166 BALLERMA</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I WAITED for the Lord my God, 
 And patiently did bear;
 At length to me He did incline,
 My voice and cry to hear.
[V2]
 He took me from a fearful pit
 And from the miry clay.
 And on a rock He set my feet,
 Establishing my way.
[V3]
 He put a new song in my mouth, 
 Our God to magnify;
 Many shall see it and shall fear, 
 And on the Lord rely.
[V4]
 Oh, blessed is the man whose trust 
 Upon the Lord relies,
 Respecting not the proud, nor such 
 As turn aside to lies.
[V5]
 O Lord my God, full many are
 The wonders Thou hast done;
 Thy gracious thoughts to usward far
 Above all thoughts are gone.
[V6]
 Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me 
 Oh, do Thou not restrain;
 Thy loving-kindness and Thy truth
 Let them me still maintain.
