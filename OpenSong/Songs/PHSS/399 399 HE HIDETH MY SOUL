  <title>399 HE HIDETH MY SOUL</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 A WONDERFUL Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
 A wonderful Saviour to me;
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
 Where rivers of pleasure I see.
[C]
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
 That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
 He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
 And covers me there with His hand.
[V2]
 A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
 He taketh my burden away;
 He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved; 
 He giveth me strength as my day.
[V3]
 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
 And, filled with His goodness divine,
 I sing in my rapture, Oh glory to God
 For such a Redeemer as mine!
[V4]
 When, clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
 To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
 His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
 I'll shout with the millions on high.
