 263 DOMINUS REGIT ME
 THE King of love my Shepherd is,
 Whose goodness faileth never; 
 I nothing lack since I am His
 And He is mine for ever.
[V2]
 Where streams of living water flow
 My ransomed soul He leadeth;
 And where the verdant pastures grow,
 With food celestial feedeth.
[V3]
 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
 But yet in love He sought me, 
 And on His shoulder gently laid
 And home rejoicing brought me.
[V4]
 In death's dark vale I fear no ill
 With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; 
 Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
 Thy cross before to guide me.
[V5]
 And so through all the length of days 
 Thy goodness faileth never;
 Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise 
 Within God's house for ever.
