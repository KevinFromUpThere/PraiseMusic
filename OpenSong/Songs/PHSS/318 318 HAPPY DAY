 318 HAPPY DAY
 OH happy day, that fixed my choice 
 On Thee, my Saviour and my God! 
 Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
 And tell its raptures all abroad.
 Happy day!
 When Jesus put my sins away. 
 He taught me how to watch and pray, 
 And live rejoicing every day;
 Happy day!
 When Jesus put my sins away.
[V2]
 Tis done, the great transaction's done;
 I am my Lord's, and He is mine. 
 He drew me and I followed on, 
 Charmed to confess the voice divine.
[V3]
 Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
 Fixed on this blissful centre, rest. 
 With ashes who would grudge to part 
 When called on angels' bread to feast ?
