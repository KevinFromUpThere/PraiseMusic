 318 HAPPY DAY
 OH happy day, that fixed my choice 
 On Thee, my Saviour and my God! 
 Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
 And tell its raptures all abroad.
[C]
 Happy day!
 When Jesus put my sins away. 
 He taught me how to watch and pray, 
 And live rejoicing every day;
 Happy day!
 When Jesus put my sins away.
[V2]
 Tis done, the great transaction's done;
 I am my Lord's, and He is mine. 
 He drew me and I followed on, 
 Charmed to confess the voice divine.
[V3]
 Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
 Fixed on this blissful centre, rest. 
 With ashes who would grudge to part 
 When called on angels' bread to feast ?
