  <title>001 BLEST be the Wisdom and the Power</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 BLEST be the Wisdom and the Power, The Justice and the Grace,
 That joined in council to restore
 And save our ruined race.
[V2] 
 Our father ate forbidden fruit,
 And from his glory fell;
 And we his children thus were brought To death and near to hell.
[V3]
 Blest be the Lord who sent His Son,
 To take our flesh and blood.
 To bring us life He gave His own,
 And made our peace with God.
[V4]
 He honoured all His Father's laws Which we have disobeyed;
 Ile bore our sins upon the cross,
 And our full ransom paid.
[V5]
 Behold Him rising from the grave,
 Behold Him raised on high;
 He pleads His merit there to save
 Transgressors doomed to die.
[V6]
 There on a glorious throne He reigns, And by His power divine
 Redeems us from the slavish chains Of Satan and of sin.
[V7]
 Thence soon the Son of God shall come, And with archangel voice
 Shall call His saints forth from the tomb While living saints rejoice.</lyrics>
