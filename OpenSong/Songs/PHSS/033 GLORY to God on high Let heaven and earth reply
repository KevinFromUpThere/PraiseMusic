  <lyrics>[V1]
 GLORY to God on high! 
 Let heaven and earth reply,
 Praise ye His name. 
 His love and grace adore, 
 Who all our sorrows bore; 
 Sing now and evermore
 Worthy His name.
[V2]
 Let us, a ransomed race, 
 Sing His abounding grace,
 Praise to His name.
 Tell what His arm hath done, 
 What spoils from Death He won, 
 God's well-beloved Son,
 Worthy His name.
[V3]
 Jesus, the Son of God,
 Bore sin's accursed load,
 Praise to His name.
 Sing, we who know His blood 
 Hath brought us nigh to God, 
 And crowned us with all good,
 Worthy His name.
[V4]
 Let all the hosts above 
 Join in one song of love,
 Praise to His name. 
 To Him ascribed be
 Honour and majesty, 
 Through all eternity, 
 Worthy His name.
