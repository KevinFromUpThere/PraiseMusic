<lyrics>[V1]
 I AM not skilled to understand
 What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
 I only know at His right hand 
 Stands One who is my Saviour.
[V2]
 I take Him at His word indeed—
 Christ died to save me, this I read; 
 For in my heart I find a need
 Of Him to be my Saviour.
[V3]
 That He should leave His place on high 
 And come for sinful man to die—
 You count it strange? So once did I, 
 Before I knew my Saviour.
[V4]
 And oh, that He fulfilled may see 
 The travail of His soul, in me; 
 And with His work contented be,
  As I with my dear Saviour.
[V5]
 Yea, living, dying, let me bring
 My strength, my solace from this spring—
 That He who lives to be my King
 Once died to be my Saviour.
