<lyrics>[V1]
 THY love we own, Lord Jesus, 
 In service unremitting;
 Within the veil
 Thou dost prevail, 
 Each soul for service fitting. 
 Encompassed here with failure,
 Each earthly refuge fails us;
 Beset with sin,
 Thy name alone avails us.
[V2]
 Thy love we own, Lord Jesus, 
 For, though Thy toils are ended,
 Thy tender heart
 Doth take its part
 With those Thy grace befriended. 
 Thy sympathy how precious! 
 Thou succourest in sorrow,
 And bid'st us cheer
 While pilgrims here, 
 And haste the hopeful morrow.
[V3]
 Thy love we own, Lord Jesus; 
 Thy way is traced before Thee—
 Thou wilt descend
 And we ascend 
 To meet in heavenly glory.
 Soon shall the blissful morning
 Call forth Thy saints to meet Thee,
 Our only Lord,
 Alone adored:
 With gladness then we'll greet Thee.
[V4]
 Thy love we own, Lord Jesus, 
 And wait to see Thy glory;
 To know as known
 And fully own
 Thy perfect grace before Thee. 
 We plead Thy parting promise, 
 Come, Saviour, to release us;
 Then endless praise
 Our lips shall raise 
 For love like Thine, Lord Jesus.
