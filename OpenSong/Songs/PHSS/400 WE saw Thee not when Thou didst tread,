<lyrics>[V1]
 WE saw Thee not when Thou didst tread, 
 O Saviour, this our sinful earth;
 Nor heard Thy voice restore the dead, 
 And wake them to a second birth;
 But we believe that Thou didst come, 
 And quit for us Thy glorious home.
[V2]
 We were not with the faithful few
 Who stood Thy bitter cross around,
 Nor heard Thy prayer for those who slew, 
 Nor felt the earthquake rock the ground. 
 We saw no spear-wound pierce Thy side; 
 Yet we believe that Thou hast died.
[V3]
 No angel's message met our ear
 On that first glorious Lordly day,
 "The Lord is risen, He is not here, 
 Come see the place where Jesus lay;" 
 But we believe that Thou didst quell 
 The banded powers of death and hell.
[V4]
 We saw not Thee return on high.
 And now, our longing sight to bless,
 No rays of glory from the sky
 Shine down upon our wilderness;
 Yet we believe that Thou art there,
 And seek Thee, Lord, in praise and prayer.
[V5]
 We heard Thee not when Thou didst say,
 "I leave you now, but soon will come 
 And take you from this world away
 To dwell with Me in My bright home;
 "But we believe Thou'It soon return;
 To see Thee, Lord, our spirits yearn.
