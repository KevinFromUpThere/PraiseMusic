<lyrics>[V1]
 GREAT the joy when Christians meet; 
 Christian fellowship, how sweet, 
 When, our theme of praise the same, 
 We exalt Jehovah's name!
[V2]
 Sing we then eternal love.
 Such as did the Father move.
 He beheld the world undone;
 Loved the world, and gave His Son.
[V3]
 Sing the Son's unbounded love, 
 How He left the realms above,
 To rejoin the Father's side
 With a blood-bought, spotless Bride.
[V4]
 Sing we too the Spirit's love,
 With our stubborn hearts He strove. 
 He revealed the Son of God
 And the value of His blood.
[V5]
 Sweet the thought, exceeding sweet, 
 We shall soon in glory meet,
 Where, the Saviour still the theme, 
 We shall ever sing of Him.
