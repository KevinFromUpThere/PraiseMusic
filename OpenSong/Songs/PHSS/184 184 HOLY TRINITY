<lyrics>[V1]
 184 HOLY TRINITY
 I bow me to Thy will, O God,
 And all Thy ways adore;
 And every day I live I'd seek
 To please Thee more and more.
[V2]
 Why should I care, O blessed God,
 Since all my cares are Thine? 
 Why not in triumph live, since Thou
 Hast made Thy triumphs mine?
[V3]
 Lead on, lead on triumphantly,
 O blessed Lord, lead on;
 Faith's pilgrim sons behind Thee seek
 The road that Thou hast gone.
[V4]
 He always wins who sides with God, 
 To him no chance is lost;
 God's will is sweetest to him when 
 It triumphs at his cost.
[V5]
 Ill that God blesses is our good, 
 And unblest good is ill;
 And all is right that seems most wrong
 If, Lord, it be Thy will. Amen.
