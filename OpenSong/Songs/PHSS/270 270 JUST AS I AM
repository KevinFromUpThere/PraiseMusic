 270 JUST AS I AM
 O HOLY Saviour, Friend unseen,
 Since on Thine arm Thou bidd'st us lean, 
 Help us throughout life's changing scene 
 By faith to cling to Thee.
[V2]
 Blest with this fellowship divine,
 Take what Thou wilt, we'll ne'er repine; 
 Since, blessed Saviour, we are Thine, 
 And we may cling to Thee.
[V3]
 Far from our home, fatigued, oppressed, 
 Here we have found our place of rest, 
 As exiles still, yet not unblest,
 While we can cling to Thee.
[V4]
 Without a murmur, we'd dismiss 
 Our former dreams of earthly bliss; 
 Our joy, our consolation this,
 Each hour to cling to Thee.
[V5]
 What though the world deceitful prove, 
 And earthly friends and hopes remove? 
 With patient, uncomplaining love,
 Still would we cling to Thee.
[V6]
 Oft when we seem to tread alone
 Some barren waste with thorns o'ergrown, 
 Thy voice of love in gentlest tone
 Whispers, "Still cling to Me."
[V7]
 Blest is our lot, whate'er befall; 
 What can affright or who appal, 
 While as our strength, our rock, our all,
 Saviour, we cling to Thee?
