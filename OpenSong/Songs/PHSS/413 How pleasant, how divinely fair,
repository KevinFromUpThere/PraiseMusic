<title>413 MONTGOMERY</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 How pleasant, how divinely fair,
 O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! 
 With long desire my spirit faints
 To join th' assemblies of Thy saints.
[V2]
 My flesh would rest in Thine abode, 
 My panting heart cries out for God;
 My God, my King, why should I be 
 So far from all my joys and Thee?
[V3]
 The sparrow chooses where to rest, 
 And for her young provides her nest; 
 But will my God to sparrows grant 
 That pleasure, and let His saints want?
[V4]
 Blest are the saints that find a place 
 Within the temple of Thy grace; 
 There they behold Thy gracious rays, 
 And seek Thy face and learn Thy praise.
[V5]
 Yea, blest are they whose hearts are set 
 To find the way to Zion's gate;
 God is their strength, and on the road 
 They lean upon their Helper, God.
[V6]
 Cheerful they walk with growing strength, 
 Till all shall meet in heaven at length; 
 There, never more to weep or fear, 
 Before Thy face shall each appear.
