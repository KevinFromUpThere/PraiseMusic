<lyrics>[V1]
 MY chains are snapt, the bonds of sin are broken, 
 And I am free!
 Oh, let the triumphs of His grace be spoken,
 Who died for me!
[V2]
 O Death, O Grave, I do not dread your power,
 The ransom's paid;
 On Jesus, in that dark and dreadful hour,
  My guilt was laid.
[V3]
 Yes, He has borne it, borne in love unbounded
 What none can know;
 He passed through death, and gloriously confounded 
 Our every foe.
[V4]
 And now He's risen; proclaim the joyful story—
 The Lord's on high;
 And we in Him are raised to endless glory,
 And death defy.
[V5]
 We wait to see the Morning Star appearing
 In glory bright.
 This blessed hope illumes, with beams most cheering, 
 The hours of night.
