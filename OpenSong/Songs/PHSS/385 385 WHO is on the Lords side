<lyrics>[V1]
 385 WHO is on the Lords side
 WHO is on the Lords side
 Who will serve the King?
 Who will be His helpers, 
 Other lives to bring?
 Who will leave the world's side? 
 Who will face the foe?
 Who is on the Lord's side?
 Who for Him will go?
 By Thy great redemption,
 By Thy grace divine,
 We are on the Lord's side;
 Saviour, we are Thine!
[V2]
 Not for weight of glory, 
 Not for crown or palm, 
 Enter we the army,
 Raise the warrior's psalm; 
 But for love that claimeth
 Lives for whom He died—
 He Christ Jesus nameth
 Must be on His side!
[V3]
 Thou, O Lord, hast bought us,
 Not with gold or gem,
 But with Thine own life blood,
 For Thy diadem.
 With Thy blessing filling
 All who come to Thee,
 Thou hast made us willing,
 Thou hast made us free.
[V4]
 Fierce may be the conflict,
 Strong may be the foe, 
 But the King's own army
 None can overthrow; 
 Round His standard ranging,
 Victory is secure,
 For His truth unchanging 
 Makes the triumph sure.
