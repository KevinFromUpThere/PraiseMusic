<lyrics>[V1]
 WORK, for the night is coming,
 Work through the morning hours; 
 Work while the dew is sparkling,
 Work 'mid springing flowers;
 Work when the day grows brighter,
 Work in the glowing sun;
 Work, for the night is coming,
 When man's work is done.
[V2]
 Work, for the night is coming,
 Work through the sunny noon; 
 Fill brightest hours with labour,
 Rest comes sure and soon. 
 Give every flying minute
 Something to keep in store; 
 Work, for the night is coming, 
 When man works no more.
[V3]
 Work, for the night is coming,
 Under the sunset skies;
 While their bright tints are glowing 
 Work, for daylight flies.
 Work till the last beam fadeth,
 Fadeth to shine no more;
 Work while the night is darkening,
 When man's work is o'er.
