  <title>15 ABERYSTWYTH</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 NAILED upon Golgotha's tree, 
 Faint and bleeding, who is He? 
 Hands and feet so rudely torn,
 Wreathed with crown of twisted thorn. 
 Once He lived in heaven above, 
 Happy in His Father's love;
 Son of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, 
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
[V2]
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, 
 Mocked and taunted, who is He? 
 Scorners tell Him to come down, 
 Claim His kingdom and His crown. 
 He it was who came to bless,
 Full of love and tenderness; 
 Son of Man, 'tis He, 'tis He, 
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
[V3]
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, 
 As a Victim, who is He? 
 Bearing sin, but not His own, 
 Suffering agony unknown. 
 He, the promised sacrifice,
 For the sinner bleeds and dies; 
 Lamb of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, 
 Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
