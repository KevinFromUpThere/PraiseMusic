 255  I HAVE A FRIEND
 I HAVE a Friend, whose faithful love 
 Is more than all the world to me; 
 'Tis higher than the heights above, 
 And deeper than the soundless sea.
 So old, so new,
 So strong, so true;
 Before the earth received its frame 
 He loved me. 
 Blessed be His name!
[V2]
 He held the highest place above, 
 Adored by all the sons of flame; 
 Yet, such His self-denying love, 
 He laid aside His crown and came
 To seek the lost,
 And, at the cost
 Of heavenly rank and earthly fame, 
 He sought me. 
 Blessed be His name!
[V3]
 It was a lonely path He trod,
 From every human soul apart; 
 Known only to Himself and God 
 Was all the grief that filled His heart;
 Yet from the track
 He turned not back
 Till, where I lay in want and shame, 
 He found me. 
 Blessed be His name!
[V4]
 Then dawned at last that day of dread 
 When, desolate, yet undismayed,
 With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head
 He, now forsaken and betrayed, 
 Went up for me
 To Calvary,
 And, dying there in grief and shame,
 He saved me. 
 Blessed be His name!
[V5]
 Long as I live my soul shall tell
 The wonders of His matchless love; 
 And when at last I rise to dwell
 In the bright home prepared above,
 My joy shall be
 His face to see,
 And, bowing then with loud acclaim, 
 I'll praise Him. 
 Blessed be His name!
