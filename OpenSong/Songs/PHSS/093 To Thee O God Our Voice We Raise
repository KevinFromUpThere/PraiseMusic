  <title>093 To Thee Oh God Our Voice We Raise</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 To Thee, O God, our voice we raise 
 And sing Thine everlasting praise, 
 Confessing to Thy name.
 How great Thou art in holiness!
 What majesty Thou dost possess!
 We celebrate Thy fame.
[V2]
 Thou, holy everlasting God, 
 Didst sanctify us by the blood 
 Of Thy beloved Son.
 Raised from the dust of earth are we 
 To be a priesthood unto Thee,
 Made holy in that One.
[V3]
 We stand before Thee in His name; 
 O God, we have no other claim
 To draw nigh unto Thee.
 But here in Him, our holy Lord,
 We praise Thy name with one accord; 
 Accepted thus are we.
[V4]
 Our praise ascends through Christ the Lord
 According to Thy holy word;	
 The great High Priest is He.
 The Spirit gives us power to raise
 Our heart and voice in holy praise, 
 In holy praise to Thee.
[V5]
 We praise Thee for the matchless grace 
 Which gives us in Thy love a place 
 And lifts us into heaven.
 All glory, honour, majesty
 Unto Thy name for ever be
 For love so freely given. Amen.</lyrics>
