<title>83 NEWCASTLE</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 THE countless multitude on high
 Who tune their songs to Jesus' name, All merit of their own deny,
 And Jesus' worth alone proclaim. Firm on the ground of sovereign grace They stand before Jehovah's throne; The only song in that blest place
 Is, "Thou art worthy, Thou alone ! "
[V2]
 Hallelujah! Christ for sin
 Death's dark flood has entered in, Suffered all the judgment throes, Saved us from eternal woes. Hallelujah! He arose
 Victor over all His foes; Now exalted, glorified,
 Sits He at His Father's side.
[V3]
 Hallelujah! for the grace
 Giving us in Christ a place, Clothing our unworthiness
 With God's perfect righteousness. Hallelujah! let us raise
 Songs resounding with His praise; Hallelujah! strike the chord, Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Amen.
[V2]
 Salvation's glory all be paid
 To Him who sits upon the throne;
 And to the Lamb, whose blood was shed" Thou, Thou art worthy, Thou alone; For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood These robes were washed so spotless pure; Thou mad'st us kings and priests to God, For ever let Thy praise endure."
[V3]
 Let us with joy adopt the strain
 We hope to sing for ever there
 " Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain, Worthy alone the crown to wear!" Without one thought that's good to plead, Oh, what could shield us from despair, But thisï¿½though we are vile indeed,
 The Lord our righteousness is there?
