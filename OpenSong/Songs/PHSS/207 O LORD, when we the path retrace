<lyrics>[V1]
 O LORD, when we the path retrace
 Which Thou on earth hast trod,
 To man Thy wondrous love and grace,
 Thy faithfulness to God;
[V2]
 Thy love to man, so sorely tried,
 Proved stronger than the grave;
 The very spear that pierced Thy side
 Drew forth the blood to save;
[V3]
 Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
 'Midst darkness only light,
 Thou didst Thy Father's name confess, 
 And in His will delight,
[V4]
 Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
 By suffering, shame and loss;
 Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles, 
 Led only to the cross;
[V5]
 O Lord, with sorrow and with shame, 
 We meekly would confess
 How little we, who bear Thy name, 
 Thy mind, Thy will express.
[V6]
 Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind; 
 We would obedient be,
 And all our rest and pleasure find 
 In fellowship with Thee.
