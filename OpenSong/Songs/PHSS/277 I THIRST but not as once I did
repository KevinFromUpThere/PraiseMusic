  <lyrics>[V1]
 I THIRST, but not as once I did,
 The vain delights of earth to share; 
 Thy wounds, Immanuel, all forbid 
 That I should seek my pleasure there.
[V2]
 It was the sight of Thy dear cross
 First weaned my soul from earthly things, 
 And taught me to esteem as dross
 The mirth of fools and pomp of kings.
[V3]
 I want that grace that springs from Thee, 
 That quickens all things where it flows, 
 And makes a wretched thorn like me 
 Bloom as the myrtle or the rose.
[V4]
 Dear Fountain of delights unknown, 
 No longer sink below the brim,
 But overflow and pour me down 
 A living and life-giving stream.
