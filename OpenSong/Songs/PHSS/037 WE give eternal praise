<lyrics>[V1]
 WE give eternal praise
 To God the Father's love, For all our comforts here
 And better hopes above;
 He sent His own eternal Son
 To die for sins that we had done.
[V2]
 Eternal glory too,
 Who bought us with His blood From everlasting woe;
 And now He lives and soon will reign
 To see the fruit of all His pain.
[V3]
 To God the Spirit's name
 Eternal thanks we give,
 Whose new-creating power
 Makes the dead sinner live;
 His work completes the great design And fills the soul with joy divine.
[V4]
 Almighty God, to Thee
 Be endless honours done,
 The undivided Three
 And self-existent One;
 Where reason fails with all her powers, There faith prevails and love adores.
[V2]
