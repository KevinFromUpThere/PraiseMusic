<lyrics>[V1]
 WHAT raised the wondrous thought, 
 Or who did it suggest,
 That we the Church, to glory brought,
 Should with the Son be blest?
[V2]
 O God, the thought was Thine, 
 Thine only could it be;
 Fruit of the wisdom, love divine, 
 Peculiar unto Thee.
[V3]
 For sure no other mind
 For thoughts so bold, so free, 
 Greatness or strength could ever find; 
 Thine only could it be.
[V4]
 The motives too, Thine own, 
 The plan, the counsel Thine—
 Made for Thy Son, bone of His bone, 
 In glory bright to shine.
[V5]
 O God, with great delight
 Thy wondrous thought we see 
 "Upon His throne in glory bright
 The Bride of Christ shall be."
[V6]
 Sealed with the Holy Ghost,
 We triumph in that love; 
 Thy wondrous thought has made our boast
 "Glory with Christ above."
