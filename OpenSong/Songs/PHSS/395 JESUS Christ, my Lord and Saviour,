<lyrics>[V1]
 JESUS Christ, my Lord and Saviour,
 Once became a child like me; 
 Oh, that in my whole behaviour
 He my pattern still might be!
[V2]
 All my nature is unholy,
 Pride and passion dwell within; 
 But the Lord was meek and lowly, 
 And was never known to sin.
[V3]
 While I'm often vainly trying
 Some new pleasure to possess,
  He was always self-denying,
 Patient in His worst distress.
[V4]
 Let me never be forgetful
 Of His precepts any more, 
 Idle, passionate, nor fretful,
 As I've often been before.
[V5]
 Lord, though now Thou art in glory, 
 I have Thine example still;
 I can read Thy sacred story,
 And obey Thy holy will.
[V6]
 Help me by that rule to measure
 Every word and every thought, 
 Thinking it my greatest pleasure,
 There to learn what Thou hast taught.
