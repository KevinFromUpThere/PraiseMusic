<title>373 HEBER</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 FROM Greenland's icy mountains,
 From India's coral strand,
 Where Afric's sunny fountains
 Roll down their golden sand; 
 From many an ancient river,
 From many a palmy plain, 
 They call us to deliver
 Their souls from error's chain.
[V2]
 What though the spicy breezes
 Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle, 
 Though every prospect pleases,
 And only man is vile?
 In vain with lavish kindness
 The gifts of God are strewn; 
 The heathen in his blindness,
 Bows down to wood and stone.
[V3]
 Shall we whose souls are lighted
 With wisdom from on high, 
 Shall we, to man benighted,
 The lamp of life deny? 
 Salvation, oh salvation,
 The joyful sound proclaim, 
 Till each remotest nation
 Has heard Messiah's name.
[V4]
 Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
 And you, ye waters, roll,
 Till Christ shall come to gather
 His own from pole to pole. 
 Soon o'er redeemed creation,
 The Lamb for sinners slain, 
 In bliss shall come to reign.
