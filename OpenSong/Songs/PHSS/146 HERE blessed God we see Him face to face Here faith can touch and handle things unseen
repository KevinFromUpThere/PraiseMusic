<lyrics>[V1]
 HERE, blessed God, we see Him face to face; Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;
 Here would we grasp with firmer hands His grace, And all our weariness upon Him lean.
[V2]
 Here would we feed upon the bread of God, Here drink with Him the royal wine of heaven; Here would we lay aside each earthly load, Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.
[V3]
 We have no help but His, nor do we need Another arm save His to lean upon.
 It is enough, O God, enough indeed,
 Our strength is in His might, His might alone.
[V4]
 Ours is the sin, but His the righteousness, Ours is the guilt, but His the cleansing blood. Here is our robe, our refuge, and our peace,
 The righteousness He wrought, O Lord our God.
[V5]
 Too soon we rise, the symbols disappear,
 The feast, though not the love, is past and gone; The bread and wine remove, but He is here, Nearer than ever, still our Shield and Sun.
[V6]
 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by, Yet passing points to the glad feast above, Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,
 The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
