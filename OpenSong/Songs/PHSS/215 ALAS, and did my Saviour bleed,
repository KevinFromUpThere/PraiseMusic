<lyrics>[V1]
 ALAS, and did my Saviour bleed,
 And did my Sovereign die?
 Did He devote that sacred head
 For such a worm as I?
[V2]
 Was it for sins that I had done
 He groaned upon the tree? 
 Amazing pity, grace unknown,
 And love beyond degree!
[V3]
 Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
 And shut its glories in,
 When the incarnate Maker died
 For man, His creature's sin.
[V4]
 Thus might I hide my blushing face
 While Calvary's cross appears;
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
 And melt mine eyes to tears.
[V5]
 But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
 The debt of love I owe;
 Fain would I give myself away;
