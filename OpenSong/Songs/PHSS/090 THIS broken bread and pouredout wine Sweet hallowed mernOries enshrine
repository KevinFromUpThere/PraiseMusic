<lyrics>[V1]
 THIS broken bread and poured-out wine Sweet hallowed mernOries enshrine
 Of that great sacrifice divineï¿½
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V2]
 Though loomed Golgotha in His view, His forethought made this statute new" This in remembrance of Me do;"
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V3]
 The loaf He took spake of that frame, Prepared by God for Him who came To manifest His Father's nameï¿½
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V4]
 He gave God thanks, the loaf He brake; "My body this, given for your sake," Words such as these in love He spake,
 Jesus, our Lord. 
 How solemn is the broken bread! Sign of His holy body, dead,
 Who suffered in our room and stead; Jesus, our Lord.
[V5]
 The cup doth memOries impart
 Of His kind sympathetic heart,
 For He of blood and flesh took part; Jesus, our Lord.
[V6]
 The cup of wine poured out we see; This speaks of pardon full and free, But tells of His deep agonyï¿½
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V7]
 His woe and travail now are o'er; He who sin's dreadful burden bore Now lives triumphant evermore!
 Jesus, our Lord.
[V9]
 A few times more, if so it be,
 We keep His words, "Remember Me," And then with joy Himself we seeï¿½Jesus, our Lord.
 9BOYLSTON
 WE bless Jehovah's name,
 Our sins are all forgiven;
 To suffer once to earth Christ came, And now He's crowned in heaven.
[V2]
 His body offered up,
 His blood shed once for all,
 This broken loaf and poured-out cup So preciously recall.
[V3]
 We never would forget
 His rich, unbounded love,
 Our theme of joy and wonder here, Our endless song above. Amen.
 92t MELCOMBE
 WE never would forget His love, Who has redeemed us by His blood, And now as our High Priest above Lives as our Advocate with God.
[V2]
 We never would forget the pain,
 The blood-like sweat, the shameful tree, The wrath His soul did once sustain, From sin and death to set us free.
[V3]
 In broken bread and out-poured wine We hear Him say, " Remember Me;
 I gave My life, a price divine,
 I bore the wrath to set you free."
[V4]
 O God, we gladly praise His love, Who suffered for us on the tree;
 And till He come from heaven above We keep His wordï¿½" Remember Me."
 93t MARIENBERG
 To Thee, O God, our voice we raise And sing Thine everlasting praise, Confessing to Thy name.
 How great Thou art in holiness!
 What majesty Thou dost possess!
 We celebrate Thy fame.
[V2]
 Thou, holy everlasting God, Didst sanctify us by the blood Of Thy beloved Son.
 Raised from the dust of earth are we To be a priesthood unto Thee,
 Made holy in that One.
[V3]
 We stand before Thee in His name; O God, we have no other claim
 To draw nigh unto Thee.
 But here in Him, our holy Lord,
 We praise Thy name with one accord; Accepted thus are we.
[V4]
 Our praise ascends through Christ the According to Thy holy word;	[Lord,
 The great High Priest is He.
 The Spirit gives us power to raise
 Our heart and voice in holy praise, In holy praise to Thee.
[V5]
 We praise Thee for the matchless grace Which gives us in Thy love a place And lifts us into heaven.
 All glory, honour, majesty
 Unto Thy name for ever be
 For love so freely given. Amen.
 94t AURELIA
 THE Holies now we enter
 In perfect peace with God, Regaining the lost centre
 Through Christ's atoning blood; Though great may be our dulness
 In thought and word and deed, We glory in the fulness
 Of Him who meets our need.
[V2]
 Much incense is ascending
 Before th' eternal throne; God graciously is bending
 To listen to His own.
 Though feeble are our praises
 Christ adds His sweet perfume, And love the censer raises
 Their odours to consume.
[V3]
 O God, we come with singing
 Because the great High Priest Our names to Thee is bringing,
 Nor e'er forgets the least. For us He wears the mitre
 Where holiness shines bright; For us His robes are whiter Than heaven's unsullied light.
 95t HEBER
 O BLESSED God, the Father
 Of Jesus Christ our Lord, In Him we are before Thee,
 According to Thy word;
 A kingdom He has made us,
 Priests unto Thee Most High, And we (as Thou hast bade us)
 As worshippers draw nigh.
[V2]
 We meditate in wonder,
 O God, upon Thy love;
 Thy matchless grace we ponder
 That sent Christ from above; We think with joy, yet sadness,
 Of how He stooped to die,
 And praise Thy name with gladness
 He's seated now on high.
[V3]
 We praise Thee for the savour
 Of His most blessed name,
 Who brought such glory to Thee,
 Who did Thy love proclaim; He was for Thee an offering
 Devoted to Thy will;
 He gave Thee boundless pleasure, He Thee delighteth still.
 96t WIR PFLOGEN
 IN-ro Thy holy presence,
 O God, we venture now,
 With reverent hearts and holy awe
 Before Thy throne to bow.
 We plead not our own virtues,
 They cannot here avail, But by the blood of Jesus
 We enter through the veil.
 For the gift Thou gayest. Thy Son from heaven above, We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V2]
 No guilty fears assail us
 As those defiled with sin, But as a holy priesthood now With joy we enter in.
 Our great High Priest before us
 Has opened up the way,
 And clothed in His perfections We would our homage pay.
 For the gift Thou gayest, Thy Son from heaven above, We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V3]
 Through Him our sacrifices Acceptable will be,
 Though not of earthly gifts received We tender unto Thee.
 To sacrifice of praises
 That unto Thee ascends,
 His blessed name and person
 An incense-fragrance lends.
 For the gift Thou gayest, Thy Son from heaven above,
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
[V4]
 We praise Thee and we worship,
 Thou great all-loving One,
 For giving up Thy Son to death
 For sins which we had done. His death and resurrection
 Have brought us nigh to Thee, Now with our hearts adoring
 To Thee we bow the knee.
 For the gift Thou gayest, Thy Son from heaven above,
 We thank Thee, Lord,
 We praise Thee, Lord,
 Thou God of matchless love.
 GATHERED in the name Lord Jesus, Breaking bread at His command, Looking at the mystic tokens
 We behold and understand
 How for us He left the glory
 As a Man 'mongst men to dwell, Gave His life-blood, wondrous story, Thus to rescue us from hell.
[V2]
 Now with holy boldness bringing
 Firstfruits of our lies to God, Fruit of lips we join in singing
 Jesus' praise with one accord. Many hearts as one united,
 Many voices blend in one,
 As we raise our loud hosannas,
 Praises to our God alone.
[V3]
 Jesus' death and resurrection
 Is the theme that fills our heart; On the cross for our redemption
 He was pierced with judgment's dart. For us stricken, smitten, bruised,
 For us bearing sin's vast load; All the wrath of God endured,
 Paid our debt with His life's blood.
[V4]
 In the silent grave they lay Him,
 Seal the stone and guard it well. Sheol's fetters cannot hold Him,
 Powerless all the hosts of hell.
 He comes forth o'er death victorious,
 See Him now the risen One,
 Prince of life and King of glory,
 Raised to heaven's eternal throne.
[V5]
 Prophet, Priest and King, behold Him,
 Saviour, Shepherd, Christ and Lord; Heaven's myriads bow before Him,
 Praise His name with one accord. Saints on earth their voices raising
 Shout the praises, bless the name Of the One who died to save us,
 Jesus evermore the same.
 98t TRINITY
 HOLY, holy, holy, we now come before Thee, Gathered in that holy name so very dear to Thee.
 O Lord God, we own Thee, humbly we adore Thee, For Thy grace and power and truth and love we see.
[V2]
 Thou Thy Son hast given, see His body riven,
 Pierced with cruel thorn and spear upon Golgotha's tree. For our sins He suffered, and His body offered,
 And His blood outpoured a sacrifice to Thee.
[V3]
 Now through Jesus' merit, gathered by the Spirit,
 Here within the holy place, through Him we boldly c-_,me; Hearts and voices blending, praise to Thee ascending, Through our great High Priest we worship Thee alone.
[V4]
 Holy, holy, holy, humbly we adore Thee,
 Honour, blessing, power and might we would ascribe to Thee ; Courts of heaven ringing with the praise were bringing,
 For the One who lives our living Lord to be.
 O Lord, Thy courts we humbly tread, By Thy blest Spirit hither led;
 We bring our sacrifice of praise, Adoring Thee in grateful lays.
[V2]
 Chosen in Christï¿½oh, wondrous grace; Assured by Him a heavenly place!
 Ere worlds at Thy command were made, Salvation's wondrous plan was laid.
[V3]
 How could Thy heart such love conceiveï¿½To slay Thy Son and us receive?
 To charge with guilt the Holy One, Forsake Thy well-beloved Son?
[V4]
 The stream of love divine alone
 Through Christ could pardon and atone; Eternal ages it had flowed,
 And at the cross its fulness showed.
[V5]
 Accepted through His death are we To be a priesthood, serving Thee.
 What joy is ours, through saving grace, To worship in the holy place!
[V6]
 Thus boldly we now enter in,
 Cleansed by Christ's blood from every sin; It speaks for us before Thy throne, Proclaims redemption's work is done.
[V7]
 Great God, Thy love all love excels; It humbles us, yet praise compels! Eternally our song shall be
 Of Him who said, " Remember Me."
 BASKETS full of firstfruits,
 Sacrifice of praiseï¿½
 Songs of our Redeemer
 Joyfully we raise.
 Lord, we come before Thee
 Through the living way, Worshipping with gladness
 On this holy day.
[V2]
 All His deeds of kindness, Every act of grace
 Led Him but to Calvary
 And the outside place. There we see Him dying,
 Bowing to Thy will;
 Lamb of Thy providing,
 Loving sinners still!
[V3]
 Bought with blood most precious. Pardoned through His death, Now a holy priesthood
 (Thus the scripture saith),
 In Thy holy presence
 We would humbly dwell; Hearts by Christ redeemed
 Songs of praises swell.
[V4]
 Lord, we only offer
 But a thousandth part
 Of the love that's owed Thee From each ransomed heart.
 Praise we now the Father,
 Praise be to the Son
 And the Holy Spiritï¿½Praise the Three in One.
 PEN LAN
 WE come with hearts obedient,
 Our God, to worship Thee;
 The symbols we have taken
 In hallowed memOry
 Of Christ, Thy well-beloved,
 The darling of Thy heartï¿½
 At Calvary we see Him
 Pierced through with judgment's dart.
[V3]
 Deep shadows crossed His pathway, Yet deeper still to be;
 We hear His cry of sorrow
 In dark Gethsemane.
 For He alone must suffer,
 Alone the cup must drain
 Of wrath and Thy forsaking,
 Our pardon to obtain.
[V2]
 We trace the way appointed
 That led to Calvary's hill,
 From birth to death obedient
 To Thy most holy will. Thyself in Him reflected,
 O God, what grace and kindness In all His actions shine!
[V4]
 The Lamb of Thy providing
 Was on the altar laid;
 Our sins were laid upon Him,
 And thus our debt was paid.
 'Twas love divine that bound Him
 In death upon the tree,
 And, joined with sovereign mercy, Has set the captives free.
[V5]
 Freed by such love, we ponder
 The fulness of His grace,
 That brings us in with gladness
 Within the holy place.
 O God, our hearts united
 Would praise Thee for Thy Son, For all in wondrous kindness
 That Thou, through Him, hast done.
[V6]
