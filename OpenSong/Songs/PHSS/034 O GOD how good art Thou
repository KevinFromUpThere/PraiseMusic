  <lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, how good art Thou!
 Before Thy throne we bow,
 We praise Thy name. 
 Thou art the only wise,
 Thy throne above the skies, 
 Thy glory never dies;
 We praise Thy name.
[V2]
 Oh, what a gift Thy Son!
 He all Thy will has done,
 His name we praise. 
 He bore the penalty,
 He suffered on the tree, 
 He set the captives free; 
 His name we praise.
[V3]
 The Paraclete came down,
 The gracious work to crown.
 His name we praise.
 He, sent in Jesus' name,
 Down from the glory came, 
 Our souls with love to 'nflame; 
 His name we praise.
[V4]
 Thou blessed Trinity, 
 We lowly worship Thee,
 We praise Thy name.
 Taught by the heavenly Dove,
 We lift our hearts above,
 We sing Thy power and love,
 His name we praise.</lyrics>
