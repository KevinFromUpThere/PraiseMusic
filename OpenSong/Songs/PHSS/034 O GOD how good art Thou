<lyrics>[V1]
 O GOD, how good art Thou!
 Before Thy throne we bow,
 We praise Thy name. Thou art the only wise,
 Thy throne above the skies, Thy glory never dies;
 We praise Thy name.
[V2]
 Oh, what a gift Thy Son!
 He all Thy will has done,
 His name we praise. He bore the penalty,
 He suffered on the tree, He set the captives free; His name we praise.
[V3]
 The Paraclete came down,
 The gracious work to crown.
 His name we praise.
 He, sent in Jesus' name,
 Down from the glory came, Our souls with love to 'nflame; His name we praise.
[V4]
 Thou blessed Trinity, We lowly worship Thee,
 We praise Thy name.
 Taught by the heavenly Dove,
 We lift our hearts above,
 We sing Thy power and love,
