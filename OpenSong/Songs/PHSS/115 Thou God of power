  <lyrics>[V1]
 Thou God of power and God of love, 
 The seraphs in the realms above
 To Thee their praises bring,
 And veil their faces while they cry,
 "Thrice holy" to their God Most High,
 "Thrice holy" to their King.
[V2]
 Thee as our God we too would claim, 
 And bless the precious Saviour's name
 Through whom this grace is given; 
 Who bore the wrath to sinners due, 
 Who formed our ruined souls anew,
 And made us heirs of heaven.
[V3]
 Give us to know the joy and love 
 With which all worship Thee above 
 In heaven, Thy blest abode.
 Here to our hearts Thyself reveal, 
 And all assembled cause to feel 
 The presence of our God.
