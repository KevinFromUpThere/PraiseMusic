<lyrics>[V1]
 WHEN Israel, by divine command. 
 The pathless desert trod,
 They found through all that barren land 
 A sure resource in God.
[V2]
 A cloudy pillar marked the road
 And screened them from the heat;
  From the hard rock the water flowed,
 And manna was their meat.
[V3]
 Like them we have a rest in view
 Secure from adverse powers;
 Like them we pass a desert too,
 But Israel's God is ours.
[V4]
 His word a light before us sheds,
 By which our path we see;
 His love a banner o'er our heads
 From harm preserves us free.
[V5]
 Jesus, the Bread of life, is given
 To be our daily food,
 And from the Rock that once was riven 
 We drink the streams of God.
[V6]
 And soon we'll reach our heavenly rest
 And lay our burdens down;
 We'll join the myriads of the blest
 Who there surround the throne.
