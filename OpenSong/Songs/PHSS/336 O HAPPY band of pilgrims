<lyrics>[V1]
 O HAPPY band of pilgrims
 If onward ye will tread,
 Christ Jesus as your Master,
 Christ Jesus as your Head.
[V2]
 Oh, happy if ye labour
 As He did toil for men; 
 Oh, happy if ye hunger
 As He did hunger then.
[V3]
 The cross that Christ has carried, 
 He carried as your due;
 But now the crown He weareth,
 And you may wear one too.
[V4]
 The faith by which ye see Him,
 The hope in which ye yearn,
 The love that through all troubles
 To Him alone will turn;
[V5]
 The trials that beset you,
 The sorrows ye endure, 
 The manifold temptations
 That here we cannot cure;
[V6]
 What are they but His jewels
 Of right celestial worth? 
 What are they but a ladder
 Set up to heaven on earth?
[V7]
 O happy band of pilgrims,
 Look upward to the skies, 
 Where such a light affliction
 Shall win so great a prize.
