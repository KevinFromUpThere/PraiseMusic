  <title>025 Praise Him! Praise Him!</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
 Sing, you saints, His wonderful love proclaim;
 Hail Him! Hail Him! Mightiest angels in glory,
 Strength and honour give to His holy name.
 Like a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people
 In His arms He carries them all day long
 O you saints, that dwell in the light of His presence,
 Praise Him! Praise Him! Ever in joyful song.
[v2]
 ise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
 For our sins he suffered and bled and died;
 Heâ€™s our rock, our hope of eternal salvation;
 Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
 Holy Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
 Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
 Once for us rejected, despised and forsaken,
 Prince of glory, He is triumphant now.
[v3]
 Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer,
 Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring;
 Jesus, Saviour, lives on for ever and ever;
 Laud Him! Laud Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
 Death is vanquished; tell it with joy, you faithful;
 Where is now your victory, boasting grave?
 Jesus lives! No longer your portals are cheerless,
 Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.</lyrics>
