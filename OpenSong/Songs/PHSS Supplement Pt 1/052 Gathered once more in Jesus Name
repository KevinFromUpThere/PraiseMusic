  <title>052 Gathered once more in Jesus Name</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Gathered once more in Jesus’ Name
 A happy pilgrim band;
 ‘Without the camp’, apart with Him
 To keep our Lord’s command.
 His body giv’n, His blood outpoured,
 The bread and wine portray;
 Our Saviour’s precious pledge of love,
 To help us on our way.
[v2]
 Gethsemane; the blood-like sweat;
 The scourge, the thorn-wreathed brow;
 The taunting throng, the shameful Cross,
 Appear before us now.
 In lonely grief our sins He bore,
 Alone He faced our foe.
 The Prince of life, our death endured,
 His hurt we’ll never know.
[v3]
 O God, for Him so freely giv’n,
 Accept our grateful praise;
 ‘Within the veil’ we worship Thee,
 As priests our song we raise.
 Until He come our joy shall be
 To keep this tryst of love;
 And then we’ll look upon His face
 In the bright home above.</lyrics>
