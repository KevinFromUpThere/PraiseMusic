  <title>039 How sweet is the story of God's boundless love</title>
  <lyrics>[v1] 
 How sweet is the story of God's boundless love
 That brought His blest Son from the glory above,
 Who died in our place upon Calvary's tree,
 Obtaining redemption that we might be free.
[v2]
 How wondrous the story! The claims of the throne
 Were met by the blood, which for guilt did atone;
 The judgment of sin has been borne by the Son,
 Who glorified God in the work He has done.
[v3]
 How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned!
 How rightly His Name above others is owned!
 Yes, Jesus, the Saviour, the glory-crowned Lord,
 Is worthy by all to be ever adored.
[v4]
 How bless√©d the hope of all those who believe,
 That Jesus is coming His own to receive,
 What rapture! What glory! For ever will be,
 When caught up to meet Him, our Saviour we'll see.</lyrics>
