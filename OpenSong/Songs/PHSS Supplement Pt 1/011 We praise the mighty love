  <title>011 We praise the mighty love</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 We Praise the mighty love
 Of our eternal God,
 Who gave for us His Son
 To cleanse us by His blood.
 How great, how wonderful His love!
 To welcome us and bid us come
 To worship Him in heaven above.
[v2]
 We praise the matchless grace
 Of our Great Priest above,
 Who opened up the way
 To rest within His love.
 Now through the veil we enter in,
 The Holy Place is free to us,
 And we can share His joy with Him.
[v3] We praise the gentle power
 The Spirit's work unseen,
 He lifts our hearts from earth,
 And breathes sweet thoughts of heaven.
 How faithful, how Divine, how true!
 He fills our mouths with holy praise
 And moves our hearts to worship You.
[v4]
 In songs of joyful praise
 We laud the Triune God;
 We glory in the grace
 That freed us from the rod.
 Our tongues unite with heaven's throng
 To praise your Name and sing to You
 The notes of our eternal song.</lyrics>
