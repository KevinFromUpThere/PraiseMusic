  <title>047 Lowly Man of Sorrows</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Lowly Man of Sorrows,
 Nailed upon a cross;
 Crucified Lord Jesus,
 Dying for us.
 Worthy of all honour!
 Worship, bow the knee,
 Praise His God and Father
 For Calvary.
[v2]
 Once rejected Saviour,
 Bearer of our shame;
 Conqueror and risen,
 Worthy His Name!
 Worthy of all honour!
 Bow down all His own
 Praise His God and Father
 Before His throne.
[v3]
 Now exalted Monarch
 Reigns supreme above
 We, as servants gather,
 Touched by His love.
 Worthy of all honour!
 Worship, magnify,
 Praise His God and Father
 Who lives on high.
[v4]
 Dying, risen, living,
 Victor of the cross;
 Glorified as High Priest
 Living for us.
 Worthy of all honour!
 Worship and adore.
 Praise His God and Father
 For evermore.</lyrics>
