  <title>040 Christ is our Hope, our heart's desire,</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Christ is our Hope, our heart's desire,
 Redemption's only spring!
 Creator of the world is He,
 Its Saviour and its King.
[v2]
 How vast the mercy and the love,
 On Him was laid our sin,
 It led Him to a cruel death,
 And thus His people win.
[v3]
 But now the bands of death are burst,
 The ransom has been paid;
 And He is on the Father's throne,
 In glorious robes arrayed.
[v4]
 O Christ, He is our lasting joy,
 Our ever great reward!
 Our only glory may it be
 To glory in the Lord.</lyrics>
