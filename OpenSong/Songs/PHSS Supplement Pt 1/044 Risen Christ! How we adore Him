  <title>044 Risen Christ! How we adore Him</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Risen Christ! How we adore Him
 Raised from earth's cold empty grave;
 See Him now, the King victorious
 Conqu'ring sin His life He gave:
 Praise His might,
 Infinite,
 For His people, stong to save.
[v2]
 Lift your heads, you gates eternal,
 Lift you everlasting doors,
 Open wide the heavenly portal
 Angel worship now restore.
 Glorious King!
 Let us sing,
 Bow your hearts and Him adore.
[v3]
 Past the sorrow of His passion,
 Past the crown of thorns He wore,
 Cross of His humiliation -
 Hands and feet and side they tore.
 Worthy Lamb!
 Great I AM,
 In His ear your praises pour.
[v4]
 Praise to God who raised up Jesus,
 Father of our living Lord,
 Let us evermore adore Him,
 Raise our voice with one accord -
 Raise your voice
 And rejoice,
 Sound His praises all abroad.</lyrics>
