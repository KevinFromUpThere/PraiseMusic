  <title>031 Lord of Creation</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Lord of creation,
 Maker of starscapes,
 Giver of glory,
 Light and love;
 Here we may worship,
 Welcomed in Jesus,
 Graced by your Spirit,
 Born from above.
[v2] In new creation,
 Formed in Your likeness,
 Members united
 With Christ on high
 Praise Him the Head, who
 Wise in Your counsel,
 Came as our Saviour,
 Willing to die.
[v3]
 Now we acclaim Him
 Head of the corner,
 Precious and chosen,
 Faithful and true;
 On one foundation
 Being built together,
 Lord God, our joy we
 Offer to You!</lyrics>
