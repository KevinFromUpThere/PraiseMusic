  <title>032 And did the Holy and the Just</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 And did the Holy and the Just,
 The Sovereign of the skies,
 Stoop down to man's estate and dust,
 That guilty worms might rise?
[v2]
 Yes, the Redeemer left the throne,
 The radiant throne on high,
 (Surprising mercy, love unknown)
 To suffer, bleed and die.
[v3]
 He took the rebel sinner's place,
 And suffered in his stead;
 For man, oh, miracle of grace!
 For sinful man He bled.
[v4]
 What heavenly truths and wonders dwell
 In that atoning blood!
 By this are sinners saved from hell,
 And reconciled to God.</lyrics>
