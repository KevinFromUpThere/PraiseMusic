  <title>030 Come, you saints</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Come, you saints, rejoice with Jesus,
 Called with Him His joy to share;
 Seraphs worship, angels praise Him,
 We His friends and followers are.
 Lost ones found and
 Dead ones raised
 Now the heart of Jesus cheer.
[v2]
 Praise the Lord, sing Hallelujah!
 Endless praises let us bring;
 Praise His name for these great mercies;
 Turn we now His praise to sing.
 Loudest praises
 Loudest praises
 Make the court of heaven ring.
[v3]
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 Heartfelt praise to God we give;
 They should loudest sing His praises,
 Who His blessings thus receive.
 Songs of praises
 Songs of praises
 Let us render while we live.
[v4]
 Shout, you ransomed heirs of heaven,
 Saved to show God's praises forth;
 While you shout let joys unspoken
 Fill your hearts with heavenly mirth;
 Hearts exulting,
 Songs outbursting,
 Put to shame the joys of earth.</lyrics>
