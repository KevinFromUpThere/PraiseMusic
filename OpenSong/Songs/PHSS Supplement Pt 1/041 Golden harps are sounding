  <title>041 Golden harps are sounding</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Golden harps are sounding,
 Angel voices ring,
 Heaven’s gates are opened,
 Opened for the King;
 Christ, the King of Glory,
 Jesus, King of Love,
 Has gone up in triumph
 To His throne above.
[c]
 All His work is ended,
 Joyfully we sing,
 Jesus has ascended!
 Glory to our King!
[v2]
 He Who came to save us,
 He Who bled and died,
 Now is crowned with glory
 At His Father’s side.
 Never more to suffer,
 Never more to die;
 Jesus, King of Glory,
 Has gone up on high!
[v3]
 Living for His people
 In this blessèd place,
 Calling them to glory,
 Ministering His grace;
 Our bright home preparing,
 For faithful ones, and true;
 Jesus ever lives,
 Ever loves us too.
