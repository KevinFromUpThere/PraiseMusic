  <title>051 We joy in our God, and sing of that love</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 We joy in our God, and sing of that love,
 So sovereign and free,
 Which did His heart move;
 When lost, our condition, all ruined, undone,
 He saw with compassion, and spared not His Son.
[v2]
 His Son, His delight, His loved One, He gave,
 The curse to endure - by suffering to save;
 Sure love so amazing, at Calvary told,
 Since Him it has given, no good will withhold.
[v3]
 We praise, then, our God; how rich is His grace!
 Though far from Him once - estranged from His face -
 By blood we are purchased, are cleansed and made nigh,
 And blest in Christ Jesus, our Saviour, on high.</lyrics>
