  <title>038 Oh! The love of God is boundless</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Oh! The love of God is boundless,
 Perfect, causeless, full and free!
 Doubts have vanished, fears are groundless,
 Now we know love like the sea.
 Love, the source of all our blessing;
 Love, found hanging on a tree;
 Love, that gave the spotless Victim;
 Love told out at Calvary.
[v2]
 Oh, the cross of Christ is wondrous!
 There God’s heart’s revealed to us;
 Midst the silent, deepening darkness,
 “God is light,” revealed to us
 Holy claims of justice finding
 Full expression in that scene,
 Light and love alike are telling
 What His woe and sufferings mean.
[v3]
 Oh, the sight in heaven is glorious!
 Man in righteousness is there;
 Once the Victim, now victorious,
 Jesus lives in glory fair.
 Him who met the claims of glory,
 And the need of ruined man,
 On the cross – oh, peerless story!
 God has set at His right hand.
[v4]
 Oh, what rest of soul in viewing
 Jesus on the Father’s throne;
 Yes, what peace for ever flowing
 From God’s rest in His own Son!
 In this holy place in heaven,
 Reading glory in His face,
 Knowing that it’s He, once given
 On the cross to take our place.</lyrics>
