  <title>010 Cross of Jesus Cross of Sorrow</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Cross of Jesus, cross of sorrow,
 Where the blood of Christ was shed,
 Perfect Man on you was tortured,
 Perfect God on you has bled.
[V2]
 Here the King of all the ages
 Throned in light 'ere worlds could be
 Robed in mortal flesh is dying,
 Crucified by sin for me.
[V3]
 Up in heaven, sublimest glory
 Circled round Him from the first;
 But the earth finds none to serve Him,
 None to quench His raging thirst.
[V4]
 Who shall fathom that descending,
 From the rainbow-circled throne,
 Down to earth's most base profaning,
 Dying desolate, alone.
[V5]
 From the, "Holy, Holy, Holy,
 We adore You, O most High,"
 Down to earth's blaspheming voices
 And the shout of "Crucify."
[V6]
 Cross of Jesus, cross of sorrow,
 Where the blood of Christ was shed,
 Perfect man on you was tortured,
 Perfect God on you has bled.</lyrics>
