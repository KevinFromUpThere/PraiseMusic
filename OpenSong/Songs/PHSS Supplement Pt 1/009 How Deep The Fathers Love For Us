  <title>009 How Deep The Fathers Love For Us</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 How deep the Father’s love for us,
 How vast beyond all measure,
 That He should give His only Son
 To make a wretch His treasure.
 How great the pain of searing loss;
 The Father turns His face away,
 As wounds which mar the Chosen One
 Bring many sons to glory.
[V2]
 Behold the man upon a cross,
 My sins upon his shoulders;
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
 Call out among the scoffers.
 It was my sin that held Him there
 Until it was accomplished;
 His dying breath has brought me life –
 I know that it is finished.
[V3]
 I will not boast in anything,
 No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
 His death and resurrection.
 Why should I gain from His reward?
 I cannot give an answer,
 But this I know with all my heart,
 His wounds have paid my ransom.</lyrics>
