  <title>035 One Day</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
 One day when sin was as black as could be,
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
 Dwelt amongst men, our example is He!
[c]
 Living, He loved us; dying, He saved us;
 Buried, He carried our sins far away;
 Rising, He justified freely for ever;
 One day He’s coming – O glorious day!
[v2]
 One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,
 One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
 Bearing our sins, our Redeemer is He!
[v3]
 One day they left Him alone in the garden,
 One day He rested, from suffering free;
 Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;
 Hope of the hopeless, our Saviour is He!
[v4]
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
 One day the stone rolled away from the door;
 He had arisen, o’er death He had conquered;
 Now is ascended, our Lord evermore!
[v5]
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
 One day the skies with His glory will shine;
 Wonderful day, His beloved ones bringing;
 Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is ours!</lyrics>
