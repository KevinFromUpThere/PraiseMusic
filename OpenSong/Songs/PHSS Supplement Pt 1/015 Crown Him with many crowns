  <title>015 Crown Him with many crowns</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Crown Him with many crowns,
 The Lamb upon His throne;
 Hark, how the heav'nly anthem drowns
 All music but its own.
 Awake, my soul, and sing
 Of Him who died for me,
 And hail Him as your matchless King
 Through all eternity.
[v2]
 Crown Him the Lord of life,
 Who triumphed o'er the grave,
 And rose victorious in the strife
 For those He came to save.
 His glories now we sing,
 Who died, and rose on high;
 Who died eternal life to bring,
 And lives that death may die.
[v3]
 Crown Him the Lord of love;
 Behold His hands and side -
 Those wounds yet visible above
 In beauty glorified.
 No angel in the sky
 Can fully bear that sight,
 But downward bends each burning eye
 At mysteries so bright.
[v4]
 Crown Him the Lord of years,
 The Potentate of time,
 Creator of the rolling spheres,
 Ineffably sublime!
 All haid, Redeemer, hail!
 For He has died for me;
 His praise shall never, never fail
 Throughout eternity.</lyrics>
