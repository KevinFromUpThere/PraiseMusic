  <lyrics>[v1]
 Joyful thanks give to the Father
 Of our great Lord Jesus Christ,
 Qualifies us for His service
 Shares inheritance in light;
 Saves us from the dark dominion
 Subjects of the lovely King;
 He in whom we have redemption,
 He through whom our praise we bring.
[v2]
 He, Firstborn of all creation
 Image of Your substance clear
 Full of power o’er all the nations,
 Full of power to bring us near;
 You have set Him above all things
 Made Him, of the Church, the Head,
 Reconciled His members to You
 Peace made through His blood once shed.
[v3]
 Christ in us the hope of glory
 Hidden myst’ry long concealed,
 God, we praise You for this story
 For the Son that You’ve revealed;
 His perfection’s never ending
 Never ceasing to amaze,
 Eternity then we’ll be spending
 Singing worthy words of praise.</lyrics>
