  <title>045 Praise we bring to God the Father</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Praise we bring to God the Father
 Glory to the Risen King;
 Hearts and voices gladly blending
 Songs of praises let us sing;
 Praise the Lamb
 Who was slain
 Raise our anthem, bless His name!
[v2]
 See the Lamb in glory standing,
 Heaven's myriads round the throne;
 Mighty God from times eternal
 Won the battle all alone.
 Shed His blood
 On the tree
 Shares with us His victory.
[v3]
 Men of every tongue and nation
 Give to God immortal praise;
 Lift our hearts in jubilation,
 Praise His grace through endless days.
 Trumpets sound,
 Joyful voice,
 Let us in His love rejoice.
[v4]
 Glory, honour, praise and wisdom,
 Power, wealth and strength be His;
 He is worthy to receive them,
 Gladly we aspire to this.
 Worship bring,
 Praise our King,
 Bring to Him our offering.</lyrics>
