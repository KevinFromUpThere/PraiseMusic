  <title>008 Our God Reigns</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
 Who brings good news, good news,
 Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
 Saying to Zion: Your God reigns!
 Your God reigns (four times)
[V2]
 He had no stately form, He had no majesty,
 That we should be – drawn to Him.
 He was despised and we took no account of Him,
 Yet now he reigns – with the Most High.
 Now He reigns (three times)
 With the Most High!
[V3]
 It was our sin and guilt that bruised and wounded Him,
 It was our sin – that brought Him down.
 When we like sheep had gone astray, our Shepherd came
 And on His shoulders – bore our shame.
 On His shoulders (three times)
 He bore our shame
[V4]
 Meek as a lamb that’s led out to the slaughterhouse,
 Dumb as a sheep – before its shearer,
 His life ran down upon the ground like pouring rain,
 That we might be – born again.
 That we might be (three times)
 Born again
[V5]
 Out from the tomb He came with grace and majesty,
 He is alive – He is alive.
 God loves us so – see here His hands, His feet, His side,
 Yes, we know – He is alive
 He is alive! (four times)
[V6]
 How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
 Who brings good news, good news,
 Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
 Saying to Zion: Our God reigns!
 Our God reigns! (four times)</lyrics>
