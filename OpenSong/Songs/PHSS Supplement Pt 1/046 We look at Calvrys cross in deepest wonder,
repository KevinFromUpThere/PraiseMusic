  <title>046 We look at Calvrys cross in deepest wonder,</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 We look at Calv'ry's cross in deepest wonder,
 Think of Your love, O God, that sent Your Son
 To die for us, and cause our hearts to ponder
 On the great mystery of love Divine.
[v2]
 We taste the Living Bread that came from Heaven,
 And feed upon His love so deep and wide;
 We drink the cup for our salvation given -
 And praise Him for His blood shed when He died.
[v3]
 We have no words that we alone can offer
 Worthy of His great sacrifice of love;
 We cannot fathom how He came to suffer
 'Til we shall see His lovely face above.
[v4]
 We bring our sacrifice of praise for Jesus,
 The fruit of lips confessing to His Name;
 The Holy One, whose love to us is precious,
 Our Great High Priest whose mercy we proclaim.
[v5]
 One day our bodies will be changed in glory,
 One day unfettered tongues will sing His praise,
 Caught up in clouds, we'll tell the same old story -
 The glorious gospel of redeeming grace.
