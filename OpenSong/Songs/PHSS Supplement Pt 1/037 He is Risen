  <title>037 He is Risen</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 He is risen, He is risen:
 Tell it out with joyful voice;
 He has burst His three days' prison;
 Let the whole wide earth rejoice;
 Death is conquered, man is free,
 Christ has won the victory.
[v2]
 Now the sad and fearful-hearted,
 Wear glad smile and radiant brow;
 Calvary's shadows have departed,
 All His woes are over now,
 And the Passion that He bore;
 Sin and pain can vex no more.
[v3]
 Come, with high and holy gladness
 Sing our Lord's triumphal lays
 Not one touch of twilight sadness;
 Dims the glorious morning rays
 Breaking o'er the dawning east
 There is only joy and peace.
[v4]
 He is risen, He is risen;
 He has opened heaven's gate;
 We are free from sin's dark prison,
 Risen to a holy state.
 Soon a brighter glorious beam
 On our longing eyes shall stream.
[v5]
 Triune God, let all adore You,
 Saints on earth and saints in heaven;
 Every creature bow before You,
 Who have all their being given;
 Who by grace does us restore;
 Praise to You for evermore.</lyrics>
