  <lyrics>[v1]
 Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
 The Holy One is here.
 Come bow before Him now,
 With reverence and fear.
 In Him no sin is found,
 We stand on holy ground.
 Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
 The Holy One is here.
[v2]
 Be still, for the glory of the Lord
 Is shining all around;
 He burns with holy fire,
 With splendour He is crowned.
 How awesome is the sight,
 Our radiant King of Light!
 Be still, for the glory of the Lord
 Is shining all around.</lyrics>
