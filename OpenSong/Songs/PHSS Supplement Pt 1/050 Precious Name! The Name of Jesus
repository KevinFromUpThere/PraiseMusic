  <title>050 Precious Name! The Name of Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Precious Name! The Name of Jesus,
 Son of God Most High,
 Who in love to guilty sinners
 Came to die.
[v2]
 Precious Name! The story telling
 Of His humble birth;
 Of His lonely pathway, trodden
 Here on earth.
[v3]
 Precious Name of Him the Saviour,
 Came the lost to save;
 In His grace, for ruined sinners
 All He gave.
[v4]
 Precious Name of Him who suffered
 On the shameful tree,
 Gave Himself, the willing Victim,
 Spotless He.
[v5]
 Precious Name! Enthroned in heaven,
 Still that Name He bears;
 On His brow the crown of glory
 Now He wears.
[v6]
 Precious, peerless Name of Jesus,
 None can tell its worth;
 Sweetest Name there is in heaven,
 Or on earth.</lyrics>
