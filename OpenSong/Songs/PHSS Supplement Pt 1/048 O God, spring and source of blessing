  <title>048 O God, spring and source of blessing</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 O God, spring and source of blessing,
 Grateful praise to You we bring;
 Objects of Your sovereign favour,
 Gladly of Your love we sing;
 Love that found its full expression
 In Your well-belovèd Son,
 Him, who dwelling in Your bosom,
 Has Your love made fully known.
[v2]
 Your eternal, gracious purpose
 Now to us in Christ is shown,
 Purpose full of richest blessing
 For the sons You had foreknown.
 Brought to rest within the circle
 Where love's treasures are displayed,
 There we drink the living waters,
 Taste the joys that never fade,
[v3]
 Brought to know Your Well-belovèd,
 Drawn to Him in boundless grace -
 Your effulgence, love and glory
 Shining in His blessèd face -
 We adore You, God the Father,
 May Your Name exalted be!
 Praise and worship we would render
 Now as in eternity.
