  <title>005 Overwhelmed By Love</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Overwhelmed by love,
 Deeper that oceans,
 High as the heavens.
 Ever living God,
 Your love has rescued me.
[C]
 No one could ever earn Your love,
 Your grace and mercy is free.
 Lord, these words are true,
 So is my love for You.
[V2]
 All my sin was laid
 On Your dear Son,
 Your precious One.
 All my debt He paid,
 Great is Your love for me.</lyrics>
