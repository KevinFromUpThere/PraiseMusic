  <title>014 God, the Glory His For Ever</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 God, the glory His for ever,
 Ever blest - Your only Son!
 Great the glory He's been given,
 And the glory He has won;
 Great the glory and the splendour
 Of the holy heav'nly place;
 Wonderful the Godhead glory
 Shining in the Saviour's face!
[v2]
 Lord of glory, He did enter
 Our dark world of sin and woe;
 Great His glory that was witnessed
 By His own while here below,
 He did die, and now we praiase You
 With Your Son, O God above;
 For in death He has declar√©d
 All the fulness of Your love.
[v3]
 Yes, we see Him crowned with glory,
 Highest honour You have giv'n;
 But His glory, all transcending,
 Is the light that shines in heav'n.
 He is greater, glorious Saviour,
 Than the glory He has won;
 He - the great "I AM" - all worship,
 Mighty God, Eternal One!</lyrics>
