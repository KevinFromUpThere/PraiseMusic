  <title>034 Almighty God, we rise</title>
  <lyrics>[v1] 
 Almighty God, we rise to praise,
 To thank You for Your grace;
 For Jesus Christ, our Lord and King,
 Brings us before Your face.
[v2] 
 He is the One who fills our eyes,
 As now, before Your throne,
 Hearts, minds and voices all declare;
 "Worthy, the Lamb alone!"
[v3]
 He is both Priest and Sacrifice,
 The One You freely gave;
 Our lives are new because of Him,
 We're those He came to save.
[v4]
 He takes up all we bring to You
 Into His nail-scarred hands;
 Pierced feet and wounded side show too
 The cruel sin in man.
[v5]
 But greater pain our Saviour knew,
 Dark hours at Calvary;
 As He, Sin Offering, cried aloud
 "You have forsaken Me!"
[v6]
 You'll send Him back for us one day,
 The risen, exalted Son;
 And then we'll know the joy of praise
 Among all ransomed ones.</lyrics>
