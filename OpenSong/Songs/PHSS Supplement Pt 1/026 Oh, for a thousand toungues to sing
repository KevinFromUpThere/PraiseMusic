  <title>026 Oh, for a thousand toungues to sing</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 for a thousand tongues to sing
 The great Redeemer's praise, (twice)
 The glories of our God and King,
 The triumphs of His grace! (three times)
[v2]
 "Jesus," the name that calms our fears,
 That bids our sorrows cease; (twice)
 'Tis music in our ransomed ears,
 'Tis life and health and peace. (three times)
[v3]
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
 He sets the prisoners free; (twice)
 His blood can make the foulest clean;
 His blood availed for me. (three times)
[v4]
 He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
 New life the dead receive; (twice)
 The mourning, weary souls rejoice,
 The child-like hearts believe. (three times)
[v5]
 And soon for us He'll gladly come
 To take us hence away; (twice)
 We'll sing His praise in yon bright home
 Throughout an endless day. (three times)
