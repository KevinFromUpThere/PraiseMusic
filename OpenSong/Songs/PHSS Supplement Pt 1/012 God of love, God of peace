  <title>012 God of love, God of peace.</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 God of love, God of peace we now praise Your Name
 For the gift of Your Son who from glory came;
 Gave His life on the cross, shed His precious blood,
 Took our place, guilty ones, brought us back to God;
 Boldly we enter in to the Holy Place;
 ‘Till He come, praise His love!
 See Him face to face.
[v2]
 Holy God, righteous God we now worship You;
 And we sing of Your grace, bring our off’rings too.
 Loving God, we adore You and Your dear Son;
 Prostrate bow, bending low, think of what You’ve done;
 Fruit of lips, praise the worth of that lovely One;
 Now we love You for Him, worship You alone.</lyrics>
