  <title>018 Great God, we come to You with hearts adoring</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Great God, we come to You with hearts adoring
 And sing Your praises now;
 The fruit of lips, our sacrifice outpouring,
 Before Your throne we bow.
[v2]
 The love that gave Your own dear Son from heaven
 Fills every tongue with praise;
 Thanks to our God, our sins are all forgiven,
 Our grateful songs we raise.
[v3]
 How can we pay the debt of love we owe You
 Unworthy as we are?
 Could we but bring some humble, selfless virtue
 That sin could never mar!
[v4]
 Such was the grace that led Your Son to suffer
 And pay sin's penalty
 On Calvary's cross, His precious blood to offer
 The guilty ones to free.
[v5]
 One day we'll rise to meet our blessed Saviour
 And see Him face to face;
 Then we shall sing eternal Hallelujahs
 And glory in His grace.</lyrics>
