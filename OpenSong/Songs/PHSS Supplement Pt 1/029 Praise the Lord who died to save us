  <title>029 Praise the Lord who died to save us.</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Praise the Lord who died to save us,
 Praise His ever gracious name;
 Praise Him that He lives to bless us,
 Now and evermore the same;
 Praise the Saviour!
 We would all His love proclaim.
[v2]
 Grace it was, yes, grace abounding,
 Brought Him down to save the lost.
 You above, the throne surrounding,
 Praise Him, praise Him, all His host.
 Saints adore Him;
 We are they who owe Him most.
[v3]
 We of all His hand created
 Objects of such grace alone,
 By eternal love elected,
 Destined now to share His throne,
 Sing with wonder,
 Sing of what the Lord has done!
[v4]
 Praise His name who died to save us;
 'Tis by Him His people live,
 And in Him the Father gave us
 All that boundless love could give;
 Life eternal!
 In our Saviour we receive.</lyrics>
