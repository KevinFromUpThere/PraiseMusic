  <title>027 We'll sing of the Shepherd that died</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 We'll sing of the Shepherd that died,
 That died for the sake of the flock;
 His love to the utmost was tried,
 But firmly endured as a rock.
[v2]
 When blood from a victim must flow
 This Shepherd, by pity, was led
 To stand in our place and to know
 The suffering and death in our stead.
[v3]
 Our song, then, for ever shall be
 Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus;
 No subject's so glorious as He,
 Nor theme so affecting to us.</lyrics>
