  <title>042 Glory, everlasting glory</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Glory, everlasting glory
 Be to Christ, the enthroned lamb.
 Glory, everlasting glory
 Be to His most precious Name;
 Name above all names in heaven,
 Name above all names on earth.
 Glory, everlasting glory
 Be to Him of peerless worth.
[v2]
 Throned in heaven, the Prince of Glory,
 Equal there, with God on high;
 Form of lowest servant taking,
 On the cross of shame to die;
 In obedience, strong, unswerving,
 His blest Father’s will to do;
 Death of shame, all undeservèd,
 Crucified and piercèd through.
[v3]
 Heaven’s crown of brightest glory
 Be to Him, the humbled One.
 Heaven’s robe of brightest splendour
 Be to Him and Him alone.
 In the Name of Jesus bowing,
 Every tongue shall Him confess
 Lord of earth and Lord of heaven;
 Myriads shall this Monarch bless.</lyrics>
