  <title>043 Hallelujah! Christ has conquered,</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Hallelujah! Christ has conquered,
 Conquered sin and death and hell:
 Sing aloud His mighty triumphs,
 Gladly now His praises tell:
 Hallelujah!
 Jesus has done all things well.
[v2]
 Him, who once as Man of Sorrows
 Bore for us our sins and shame,
 Glad we hail as King of glory -
 His a never-ending fame;
 Hallelujah!
 Praise, forever priase, His name.
[v3]
 Son of God, in adoration
 Low we bow before His face,
 And with loving hearts, confess Him,
 Sing the marvels of His grace,
 Hallelujah!
 Him we worship, Him we praise.</lyrics>
