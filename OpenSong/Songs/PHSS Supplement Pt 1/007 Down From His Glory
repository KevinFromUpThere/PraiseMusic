  <title>007 Down From His Glory</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Down from His glory, ever living story,
 Our Lord and Saviour came, and Jesus was His Name.
 Born in a manger, to His own a stranger,
 A man of sorrows, tears and agony.
[C]
 O how we love Him! How we adore Him!
 Our breath, our sunshine, our all in all!
 The great Creator became our Saviour,
 And all Your fullness abides in Him.
[V2]
 What condescension, bringing us redemption;
 That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight,
 God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splendour,
 Stooping to woo, to win to save our souls.

[V3]
 Without reluctance, flesh and blood His substance,
 He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan.
 O glorious mystery, Sacrifice of Calvary,
 And now we know He is the great, “I am.”</lyrics>
