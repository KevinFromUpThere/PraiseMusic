  <title>024 He dies!</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 He dies! He dies! the lowly Man of Sorrows,
 On whom were laid our many griefs and woes;
 Our sins He bore beneath God's awful billows,
 And He hath triumphed over all our foes.
[c]
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
 And behold! I am alive for evermore,
 Behold! I am alive for evermore.
 I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
 And behold! I am alive for evermore.
[v2]
 He lives! He lives! what glorious consolation!
 Exalted at His Father's own right hand
 He pleads for us, and by His intercession
 Enables all His saints by grace to stand.
[v3]
 He comes! He comes! Oh, blest anticipation!
 In keeping with His true and faithful word,
 To call us to our heavenly consummation -
 Caught up, to be for ever with the Lord.</lyrics>
