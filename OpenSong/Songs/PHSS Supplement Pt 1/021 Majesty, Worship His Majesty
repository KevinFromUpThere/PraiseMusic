  <title>021 Majesty, Worship His Majesty</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Majesty, worship His Majesty,
 Unto Jesus be glory, honour and praise.
 Majesty, kingdom authority,
 Flows from His throne unto His own,
 His anthem raise.
[v2]
 So exalt, lift up on high the name of Jesus;
 Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus the King.
[v3]
 Majesty, worship His Majesty,
 Jesus who died, now glorified,
 King of all kings.</lyrics>
