  <title>020 How Great Thou Art!</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder
 Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,
 I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
 Thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed:
[c]
 Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
 How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
 How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
[v2]
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
 And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze:
[v3]
 And when I think that God His Son not sparing,
 Sent Him to die – I scarce can take it in.
 That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,
 He bled and died to take away my sin:
[v4]
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
 And take me home – what joy shall fill my heart!
 Then shall I bow in humble adoration
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!</lyrics>
