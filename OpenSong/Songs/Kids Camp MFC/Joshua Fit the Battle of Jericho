 Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
 Jericho, Jericho
 Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
 And the walls came tumblin' down
 
 [v1]
 You may talk about your Kings of Gideon
 You may talk about your men of Saul
 But there's none like good old Joshua
 At the battle of Jericho
 
 [v2]
 Now the Lord commanded Joshua
 "I command you and obey you must;
 You just march straight to those city walls
 And the walls will turn to dust"
 
 [v3]
 Straight up to the walls of Jericho
 He marched with spear in hand
 "Go blow that ram horn" Joshua cried
 "For the battle is in my hand"
 
 [v4]
 The lamb ram sheep horns began to blow
 And the trumpets began to sound
 And Joshua commanded "now children shout!"
 And the walls came tumblin' down
