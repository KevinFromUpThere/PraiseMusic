 I want to be like Jesus, I want to do the things he does
.D                                                   G             D
 I want to look like Jesus, Show the world there's a God above who loves us
.          D
 There's a God above who loves us

[v1]
.             A       G                D
 Everything I say and do, everything I am
.              A        G                    D
 Living now to worship You with everything I can
.            A    G
 You're the only hope we have
.                D         D
 You're the greatest joy we know
.   C                   A
 My life, your love to show

[v2]
.               A         G             D
 Lord I want to think and speak, be and do
.               A     G                 D
 Everything and only that which pleases you
.        A       G
 So come take control,
.  D        G
 Suggest this day
.C                    A
 All I design, do, or say</lyrics></song>
