  <lyrics>;Intro: Em C G D/F#  Em C G D

[v1]
.Em         C             G
 Water You turned into wine
.Em          C              G 
 Opened the eyes of the blind
.               Am7
 There's no one like You
.  C        D2
 None like You

[v2]
.Em        C               G
 Into the darkness You shine
.Em          C          G
 Out of the ashes we rise
.                Am7
 There's no one like You
.          D2
 None like You

[C]
.Em
 Our God is greater
.C
 Our God is stronger 
.G                       D/F#
 God You are higher than any other
.Em
 Our God is healer
.C
 Awesome in power
.    G        D
 Our God, Our God

[v3]
.Em        C               G
 Into the darkness You shine
.Em          C          G
 Out of the ashes we rise 
.               Am7
 There's no one like You
.    C     D
 None like You


[b2]
.Em 
 And if our God is for us
.C
 Then who could ever stop us
.G
 And if our God is with us
.D/F# (D 2nd time)
 Then what could stand against</lyrics></song>
