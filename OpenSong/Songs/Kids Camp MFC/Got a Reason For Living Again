  <lyrics>[v1]
 Got a reason for living again (oh,oh,oh)
 Got a reason for laughing again (oh,oh,oh)
 Got a reason for loving again (oh,oh,oh)
 I’ve got the love of God in my heart
 
[v2]
 No reason to cry anymore
 No reason to sigh anymore
 No reason to die anymore
 I’ve got the love of God in my heart
 
[v3]
 MONDAY - I was all alone
 TUESDAY - I had my sins to atone
 WEDNESDAY - I cried and cried
 THURSDAY - Lord I thought I would die
 FRIDAY - I started to pray
 SATURDAY - I read my Bible all day
 SUNDAY - Lord, the heavens did part I’ve got
         the love of God in my heart
