  <lyrics>[v1]
 Don't build your house on the sandyland
 Don't build it too near the shore
 Well it might look kinda nice
 But you'll have to build it twice
 Oh you'll have to build your house once more
 
[v2]
 You'd better build your house upon a rock
 Make a firm foundation on a solid spot
 For the storms may come and go
 But the peace of God you will know
 
[v3]
 Rock of ages
 Cleft for me
 Let me hide myself in Thee
 
[v4]
 Don't build your house on the sandyland
 Don't build it too near the shore
 Well it might look kinda nice
 But you'll have to build it twice
 Oh you'll have to build your house once more
 
 You'd better build your house upon a rock
 Make a firm foundation on a solid spot
 For the storms may come and go
 But the peace of God you will know
 
 Rock of ages
 Cleft for me
 Let me hide myself in Thee </lyrics></song>
