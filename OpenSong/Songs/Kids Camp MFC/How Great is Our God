  <lyrics>[v1]
 The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty.
 Let all the Earth rejoice, all the Earth rejoice.
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
 And trembles at His voice, Trembles at His voice.
 
[v2]
 Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands
 Beginning and the end, begining and the end.
 The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son.
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
 
[c]
 How great is our God, sing with me.
 How great is our God, all will see,
 How great, how great is our God
 
[v3]
 Name above all names, You are worthy of all praise
 And my heart will sing how Great is our God
 (repeat)</lyrics></song>
