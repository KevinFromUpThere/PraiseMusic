  <lyrics>[c1]
 I reach up high, touch the ground
 Stomp my feet and I turn around
 I've got to (whoo whoo)
 Praise the Lord
 
[c2]
 I jump and dance with all my might
 I might look funny but that's alright
 I've got to (whoo whoo)
 Praise the Lord
 
[v1]
 I'll do anything just for my God
 'Cause He's done everything for me
 It doesn't matter who is looking on
 Jesus is the person that I want to please
 
[v2]
 May my whole life be a song of praise
 To worship God in every way
 In this song the actions praise His name
 I want my actions everyday to do the same
