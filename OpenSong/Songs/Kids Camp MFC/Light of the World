  <lyrics>[v1]
 Light of the world You stepped down into darkness
 Opened my eyes let me see
 Beauty that made this heart adore you
 Hope of a life spent with You
 
[c1]
 So here I am to worship
 Here I am to bow down
 Here I am to say that You’re my God
 
[c2]
 And You’re altogether lovely
 Altogether worthy
 Altogether wonderful to me
 
[v2]
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above
 Humbly you came to the earth you created
 All for love’s sake became poor
 
[c3]
 And I’ll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon Your cross 
 And I’ll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon Your cross
