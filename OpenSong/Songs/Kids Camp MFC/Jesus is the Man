  <lyrics> [v1]
 Jesus is the Man
 Take him by the hand
 Gonna tell the whole land
 That I am set free
 
 [v2]
 I was full of sin
 Jesus took me in
 Now I’ve got a grin
 And I am set free
 
 [c]
 OH OH OH OH OH
 OH OH OH OH  OH
 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 
 [v3]
 He knew me from the start
 Now He’s in my heart
 I will do my part
 ‘Cuz I am set free
 
 [v4]
 Truth cuts like a knife
 Lifts me from the strife
 Now I’ve got new life 
 And I am set free
