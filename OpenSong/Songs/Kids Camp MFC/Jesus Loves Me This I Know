  <lyrics>[v1]
 Jesus loves me this I know (echo)
 For the Bible tells me so (echo)
 Little ones to Him belong (echo)
 They are weak but He is strong (echo)
 
[c1]
 Singin’ nana nana nana na na
 Nana nana nana na na
 (Repeat)
 
[c2]
 Yes, Jesus loves me (clap, clap)
 Yes, Jesus loves me (clap, clap)
 Yes, Jesus loves me (clap, clap)
 The Bible tells me so.
 
[v2]
 Jesus loves me when I’m good (echo)
 When I do the things I should (echo)
 Jesus loves me when I’m bad (echo)
 Even though it’s makes Him sad (echo)
 
[v3]
 Jesus loves me He who died (echo)
 Heavens gates to open wide (echo)
 He will wash away my sin echo)
 Let this little child come in (echo)
 
[v4]
 Sing about His love, about His love sing about
 Sing about His love, about His love sing
 (repeat)</lyrics></song>
