  <lyrics>[c]
 Oh oh oh
 Jesus loves me this I know
 Oh oh oh
 For the Bible tells me so
 
[v1]
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
 Was blind but now I see
 
[v2]
 Jesus loves the little children
 All the children of the world
 Red and yellow, black and white
 All are precious in His sight
 
[v3]
 What a friend we have in Jesus
 All our sins and griefs to bear
 What a privilege to carry
 Everything to God in prayer</lyrics></song>
