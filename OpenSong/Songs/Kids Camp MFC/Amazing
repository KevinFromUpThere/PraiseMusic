  <lyrics>[v1]
 To the One who made all that I know
 Who am I
 That You should hear my song
 To the One who my whole life I owe
 I have fallen short, for so long
 
[c1]
 Yet You patiently give to me
 Your mercy and Your grace
 And I don't pretend to understand
 I only stand amazed
 I stand amazed
 
[c2]
 You are amazing
 Holy
 You know everything
 And You still love me
 You are always faithful
 And worthy of praise
 For now and for evermore
 
[v2]
 And I will ever give my praise
 To the One who has set the stars in place
 And who saved me
 And who saved me</lyrics></song>
