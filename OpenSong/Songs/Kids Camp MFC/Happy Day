  <lyrics>[V1]
.G
 The greatest day in history,
.C                                 
 Death is beaten
.                   Em
 You have rescued me, 
.                                  C  
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive!
 
[v2]
.G
 The empty cross, the empty grave,
.C                      
 Life eternal, 
.                     Em  
 You have won the day,
.                                  C
 Shout it out, Jesus is alive!  
.       D 
 He's alive!
 
[C]
.G                C               Em
 Oh, happy day, happy day,
.D
 You washed my sin away
.G                  C            Em
 Oh, happy day, happy day,
.D                                    G      C
 I'll never be the same
.Em      D                          G      
     Forever I am changed
 
[V3]
.G
 When I stand in that place,
.C                                             Em
 Free at last, meeting face to face,
.                                            C
 I am yours, Jesus you are mine.
 
[v4]
.G
 Endless joy, perfect peace,
.C                                        Em
 Earthly pain finally will cease
.                                C
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive, 
.            D
 He's alive! 
 
[B]
 And oh, what a glorious day,
 What a glorious way,
 That you have saved me!
 And oh, what a glorious day,
 What a glorious way!</lyrics>
