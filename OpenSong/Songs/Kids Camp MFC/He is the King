  <lyrics>[v1]
 Let's sing about the Lord
 The greatness of our God
 For He's the King of everything
 We're wild about His love
 And all that He has done
 For He's the King of everything
 
[v2] 
 I know God
 I talk about Him
 Every single day
 I pray to Him
 At all times
 He's the only way
 
[v3]
 I love Him, He loves me
 No matter where I go
 And everything I do
 Will be for God and God alone
 
[v4]
 He's the King of everything
 He's the King of everything</lyrics></song>
