 I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart
 I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart to stay
 
[v2]
 I've got the love of Jesus
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart
 I've got the love of Jesus
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart to stay
 
[v3]
 I've got the peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart
 I've got the peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart to stay
---
[v4]
 I've got the wonderful love of my blessed Redeemer
 Way down in the depths of my heart (where?)
 Down in the depths of my heart (where?)
 Down in the depths of my heart
 I've got the wonderful love of my blessed Redeemer
 Way down in the depths of my heart (where?)
 Down in my heart to stay
 
[v5]
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart</lyrics>
