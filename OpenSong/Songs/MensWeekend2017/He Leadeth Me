  <lyrics>[V1]
. D             D/F# G                  
 He leadeth me, O blessed thought!
. D                           A
 O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!
.D             D/F#       G
 Whate’er I do, where’er I be
.      D         Bm        D   A   D
 Still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.

[C]
.   D       A      D   G   D              Bm      D       A
 He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:
.    D        A        D G     D       Bm     D       A       D
 His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.

[V2]
 Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom,
 Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
 By waters still, o’er troubled sea,
 Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.

[V3]
. D             D/F# G            
 Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
. D                           A
 Nor ever murmur nor repine;
.D             D/F#       G
 Content, whatever lot I see,
.      D         Bm        D   A   D
 Since ’tis my God that leadeth me.

[V4]
. D             D/F# G            
 And when my task on earth is done,
. D                           A
 When by Thy grace the vict’ry’s won,
.D             D/F#       G
 E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
.      D         Bm        D   A   D
 Since God through Jordan leadeth me.</lyrics>
