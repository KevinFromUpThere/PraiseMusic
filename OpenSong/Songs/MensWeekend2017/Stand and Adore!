  <lyrics>[v1]
 Stand and adore! how glorious He
 That dwells in bright eterniry;
 We gaze and we counfound our sight,
 Plunged in th'abyss of dazzling light.
[v2]
 Thou Sacred One, Almighty Three,
 Great everlasting mystery,
 What lofty numbers shall we frame,
 Equal to Thy tremendous name?
[v3]
 Seraphs that stand around the throne
 Begin and speak the great Unknown;
 Attempt the song, wind up our strings
 To notes untried and boundless things.
[v4]
 Ye whose capacious powers survey
 Largely beoynd our eyes of clay,
 Yet what a narrow portion too
 Is seen, or known, or thought by you!
[v5]
 How flat our highest praises fall
 Below th'immense Original!
 Weak creatures we that strive in vain
 To reach an uncreated strain
[v6]
 Great God forgive our feeble lays,
 Sound out Thine own eternal praise;
 A song so vast, a theme so high, 
 Calls for the voice that tuned the sky.</lyrics></song>
