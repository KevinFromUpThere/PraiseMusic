 Sing like never before , 0 my soul , I'll worship Your holy name

[V1]
.    C         G          D       Em
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
.C             G           D    Em
  It's time to sing Your song again
.    C        G             D           Em (Playout)
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
.C          G                D       G (Playout)
  Let me be singing when the evening comes

[v2]
.       C       G                D       Em
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
.C             G               D          Em
  Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
.    C            G            D       Em (playout)
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing
.C             G              D        G (playout)
  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


[v3]
.    C       G           D           Em
 And on that day when my strength is failing
.C              G            D          Em
  The end draws near, and my time has come
.C                  G         D        Em (playout)
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
.C             G                  D    G (playout)
  Ten thousand years and then for-ever-more</lyrics>
