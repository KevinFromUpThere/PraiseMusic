  <title>I Am So Glad</title>
  <lyrics>;D Capo 2

[v1]
 I am so glad that our Father in heaven
 Tells of his love in the book he has given:
 Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
[c]
 I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
 Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
 I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
 Jesus loves even me.
[v2]
 Though I forget him, and wander away,
 Still he doth love me wherever I stray;
 Back to his dear loving arms do I flee,
 When I remember that Jesus loves me.
[v3]
 O if there's only one song I can sing,
 When in his beauty I see the great King,
 This shall my song in eternity be,
 "O what a wonder that Jesus loves me."</lyrics>
