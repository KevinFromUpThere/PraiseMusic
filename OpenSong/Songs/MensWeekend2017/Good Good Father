  <lyrics>[V1]
.A            Asus     A
 I've heard a thousand stories
.            Asus         A
 Of what they think You're like
.                  Asus   A
 But I've heard the tender whisper
.              Asus    A
 Of love in the dead of night and You
.D2      A/C#
 Tell me that You're pleased and that 
.Bm7        D
 I'm never alone

[C]
.                   D2
 You're a good, good Father, 
.                 A/C#
 It's who You are, it's who You are,
.Bm7          D
 It's who You are
.                D2
 And I'm loved by You
.              A/C#
 It's who I am, it's who I am
.Bm7        D 
 It's who I am

[V2]

.      A
 Oh and I've seen many searching for
 Answers far and wide, but I know we're all
 Searching for answers only You provide because
.   D2        A/C#
 You know just what we need before
.Bm7      E
 We say a word

 Because You are perfect 
.              F#m7
 In all of Your ways

 You are perfect in all of Your ways

 You are perfect in all of Your ways

 To us 

[V3]
.       A       Asus   A
 Oh this Love so undeniable
.        Asus    A
 I, I can hardly speak
.        Asus  A
 Peace so unexplainable
.        Asus    A
 I, I can hardly think as You 
.D2       A/C#
 Call me, deeper still as You 
.Bm7     A/C#
 Call me deeper still as You 
.D2 A/C#              Bm7
 Me deeper still into love
.     E
 Love, love
