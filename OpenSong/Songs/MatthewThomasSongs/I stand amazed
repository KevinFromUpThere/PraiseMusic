[V1]
.G
 I stand amazed in the presence
.     D     C     G
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
.      C                  G
 And wonder how He could love me,
.G         D           G
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[C]
.G
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.D
 And my song shall ever be:
.G               
 How marvelous! How wonderful!
.Am7    G         D       G
 Is my Savior's love for me!

[V2]
.G
 For me it was in the garden
.     D             C         G
 He prayed: “Not My will, but Thine.”
.   C                     G
 He had no tears for His own griefs,
.G         D             G
 But sweat drops of blood for mine.

[V3]
.G
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
.     D           C     G
 He made them His very own;
.   C                  G
 He bore the burden to Calvary,
.G         D           G
 And suffered and died alone.
---
[V4]
.G
 When with the ransomed in glory
.     D          C        G
 His face I at last shall see
.       C                     G
 ‘Twill be my joy through the ages
.G           D          G
 To sing of his love for me.

[B]
.D             G        C             G
 Then sings my soul  my Savior God to Thee
.            Am       D          G
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art
.D             G        C             G
 Then sings my soul  my Savior God to Thee
.            Am       D          G
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art</lyrics>
