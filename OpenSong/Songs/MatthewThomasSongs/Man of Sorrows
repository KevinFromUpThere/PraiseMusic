  <title>Man of Sorrows</title>
  <lyrics>;CAPO 7

[V1]
.C              Am     E
 "Man of Sorrows," what a name
.F       C      G
 For the Son of God, who came
.C              F
 Ruined sinners to reclaim!
.     C G           F  C
 Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

[V2]
.C              Am     E
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
.F       C      G
 In my place condemned He stood,
.C              F
 Sealed my pardon with His blood.
.     C G           F  C
 Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

[V3]
.C              Am     E
 Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
.F       C      G
 Spotless Lamb of God was He,
.C              F
 Full atonement!  Can it be?
.     C G           F  C
 Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

[V4]
.C              Am     E
 Lifted up was He to die;
.F       C      G
 "It is finished," was His cry;
.C              F
 Now in Heaven exalted high!
.     C G           F  C
 Hallelujah, what a Saviour!

[V5]
.C              Am     E
 When he comes, the glorious King,
.F       C      G
 All His ransomed home to bring,
.C              F
 Then anew this song we'll sing:
.     C G           F  C
 Hallelujah, what a Saviour!</lyrics>
