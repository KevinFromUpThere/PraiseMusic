  <title>You Led Me To The Cross</title>
  <lyrics>;CAPO 3

[V1]
.G                 D/F#
 You led me to the cross
.              Em7                  C              
 And I saw the face of mercy in that place of love
.G                D/F#
 You opened up my eyes
.                Em7
 To believe Your sweet salvation
.         C
 Where I'd been so blind
.A7/C#       C               G           D/F#    
 Now that I'm living in Your all forgiving love
.A7/C#    C          D      G
 My every road leads to the cross

[C]
.G      D/F#              Em    
 Jesus, keep me near the cross
.C                              G
 I won't forget the love You've shown
.G     D/F#              Em    
 Savior, teach me of the cross
.A7/C#
 I won't forget the love
.C                             G
 I won't forget the love You've shown

[V2]
.G                    D/F#
 And there's an empty tomb
.                      Em7                 C
 That tells me of Your resurrection and my life in You
.G                     D/F#
 The stone lies rolled away
.                  Em7
 Nothing but those folded grave clothes
.          C
 Where Your body lay
.A7/C#        C           G              D/F#
 Now that I'm living as a risen child of God
.A7/C#    C          D      G
 My every road leads to the cross</lyrics>
