[V1]
.G                     C
 These are the days of Elijah,
.G             D           G
 Declaring the Word of the Lord.
.G                            C               
 And these are the days of your servant Moses, 
.G          D       G
 Rightousness being restored.
.Bm                                   Em
 And though these are days of great trials,
.Am            C         D
 Of famine and darkness and sword.
.G                             C
 Still we are the voice in the desert crying,
.G             D           G
 Prepare ye the way of the lord!

[C]
.    G                          C
 Behold He comes, riding on the clouds,
.                 G                   D
 Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call,
.    G                              C
 So lift your voice its the year of Jubilee,
.           G              D      G
 and out of Zion's hill Salvation comes!

[V2]
.G                     C
 These are the days of Ezekiel,
.G             D           G
 The dry bones becoming as flesh.
.G                            C
 And these are the days of your servant David,
. G             D         G
 rebuilding the temple of praise.
.Bm                               Em
 And though these are days of the harvest,
.Am                             D
 The fields are as white in the world.
.G                        C
 And we are the laborers in your vinyard,
.G             D           G
 Declaring the Word of the Lord!</lyrics>
