.           G                  C              G         
 You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb that was slain,     
.                           C              D            
 You ascended to heaven and ever more will reign;       
.       G                       C           G           
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim,      
.                              D

[P1]
.D                                                      
 And the eyes of all men                                
.D                                                      
 will be fixed on the Lamb,                             
.        C    D                                         
 who was crucified                                      
.D                                                      
 For with wisdom and mercy                              
.D                                                      
 and justice You'll reign                               
.        C        D

.        G                 C    G   D                   
 And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb                
.        G                    C    G  D                 
 Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.'           
.        G                  C   G     D                 
 And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign             
.       G                         C            G        
 As the King of all kings and the Lord of  all lords.'

[V2]
.           G                  C              G         
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side,  
.                                   C         D         
 There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied;   
.       G                       C           G           
 As the Father has told us for these You have died,     
.                              D                        
 For the nations that gather before You.

.D                                                           
 And the ears of all men                                    
.D                                                           
 need to hear of the Lamb
.        C    D                                              
 who was crucified,                                          
.D                                                           
 Who descended to hell                                       
.D                                                           
 yet was raised up to reign                                  
.       C        D                                           
 at the Father's side.
