  <lyrics>;CAPO 3

[V1]
.     G                    Em7
 The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
.                    C2                         D
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
.   G                           Em7
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
.                     C2                        D
 And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


[C]
.    G                 D/F#
 How great is our God, sing with me,
.    Em                Em7
 How great is our God, all will see,
.    C           D            G
 How great, how great is our God.


[V2]
. G                        Em7
 Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
.                  C2                       D
 Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
.     G                     Em7
 The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
.                 C2                        D
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.


[B]
. G                  D/F#
 Name above all names,
. Em7
 Worthy of all praise,
.   C
 My heart will sing
.    D             G
 How great is our God.</lyrics>
