  <lyrics>;CAPO 1

[V1]
.     G             Em       C  D       G
 When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
.     Em           C           D   D/E  D/F#
 When sorrows like sea billows roll;
.    G       C             A2           D
 Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
.       G          C     D       G
 "It is well, it is well with my soul."

[C]
.            G     D
 It is well (It is well)
.              D       G    
 With my soul (With my soul)
.G      C           G     D      G
 It is well, it is well, with my soul.

[V2]
.     G              Em       C  D       G
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
.     Em           C           D   D/E  D/F#
 Let this blest assurance control,
.    G       C             A2           D
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
.          G           C     D       G
 And hath shed his own blood for my soul.
---
[V3]
.     G             Em       C  D       G
 My sin, o, the bliss of this glorious thought!
.     Em           C           D   D/E  D/F#
 My sin, not in part but the whole
.    G       C             A2           D
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
.           G                C     D       G
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[V4]
.     G             Em       C  D       G
 For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
.     Em           C           D   D/E  D/F#
 If Jordan above me shall roll,
.    G       C             A2           D
 No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
.             G        C     D      G
 Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

[V5]
.     G             Em       C  D       G
 But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
.     Em           C           D   D/E  D/F#
 The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
.    G       C             A2           D
 Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
.        G             C     D       G
 Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!</lyrics>
