[V1]
.G        D                    Em            C
  Blessed be Your name  in the land that is plentiful
.           G          D              C
 Where Your streams of abundance flow Blessed be Your name
.G            D                       Em           C
  And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
.         G                 D           C                C
 Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name

[P]
.G                     D              Em             C
  Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise
.G                     D               Em             C
  And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say

[C]
.               G           D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                Em  C
 Blessed be Your name
.               G           D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                Em       C
 Blessed be Your glorious name

[V2]
.G        D                      Em            C
  Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
.         G               D             C
 When the world's "all as it should be" Blessed be Your name
.G            D                    Em               C
  And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering
.               G           D        C
 Though there's pain in the offering Blessed be Your name

[B]
.    G              D
 You give and take away
.    Em             C
 You give and take away
.    G                   D
 My heart will choose to say
.      Em               C
 Lord, blessed be Your name</lyrics>
