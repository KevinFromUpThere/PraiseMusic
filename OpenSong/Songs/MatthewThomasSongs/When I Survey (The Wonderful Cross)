  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                 G        D
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.D            G         D     A
 On which the Prince of glory died,
.D                 G         D
 My richest gain I count but loss,
.D           A               D
 And pour contempt on all my pride.

[V2]
.D                       G       D
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
.D            G        D        A
 Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
.D                          G        D
 All the vain things that charm me most,
.D           A           D
 I sacrifice them to His blood.

[C]
.       G         D             G         D
 Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
.        G                D               A
 Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
.       G         D             G         D
 Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
.        G              D
 All who gather here by grace draw near
.    A
 And bless Your name

[V3]
.D                      G          D
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
.D          G          D       A
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
.D                      G      D
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
.D           A               D
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?


[V4]
.D                       G       D
 Were the whole realm of Nature mine,
.D            G        D        A
 That were an offering far too small;
.D                G     D
 Love so amazing, so divine,
.D           A                D
 Demands my soul, my life, my all!
