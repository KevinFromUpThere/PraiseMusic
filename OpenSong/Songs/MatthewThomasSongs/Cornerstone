 Intro: G   Em   C - D

[V1]
.G
 My hope is built on nothing less
.C                     D
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
.Em                   Em/D
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
.C          D          G
 But wholly trust in Jesus' name

[C]
.G/B     C     Em    D
 Christ alone, Cornerstone
.G/B       C             Em       D
 Weak made strong in the Savior's love
.G/B         C
 Through the storm
.Em    D
 He is Lord
.        G
 Lord of all

[V2]
.G
 When darkness seems to hide His face
.C               D
 I rest on His unchanging grace
.Em                Em/D
 In every high and stormy gale
.C         D            G
 My anchor holds within the veil

---
[V3]
.G
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
.C                D
 Oh may I then in Him be found
.Em                      Em/D
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
.C          D            G
 Faultless, stand before the throne

[B]
.      Em
 He is Lord
.        C  D
 Lord of all</lyrics>
