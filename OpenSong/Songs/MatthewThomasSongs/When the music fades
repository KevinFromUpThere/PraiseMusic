[V1]
.D              A
 When the music fades
.                Em
 All is stripped away
.              A
 And I simply come
.D                 A
 Longing just to bring
.                    Em
 Something that's of worth
.                      A
 That will bless your heart

[B]
.Em             D/F#         A
 I'll bring You more than a song
.              Em
 For a song in itself
.           D/F#           A
 Is not what You have required
.Em               D/F#     A
 You search much deeper within
.                       Em
 Through the way things appear
.               D        A
 You're looking into my heart

[C]
.D                      A/C#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.         Em
 And it's all about You
.     G         A      D
 It's all about You, Jesus
.D                          A/C#
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
.         Em         D/F#
 When it's all about You
.    G         A       D
 It's all about You, Jesus

[V2]
.D               A
 King of endless worth
.               Em
 No one could express
.              A
 How much you deserve
.D                   A
 Though I'm weak and poor
.               Em
 All I have is yours
.               A
 Every single breath</lyrics>
