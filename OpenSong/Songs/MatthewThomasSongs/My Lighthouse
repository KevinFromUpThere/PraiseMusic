[V1]
.G                   C     G
 In my wrestling and in my doubts,

 in my failures, You won't walk out.

 Your great love will lead me through.
.C               G           D        G
     You are the peace in my troubled sea,
.C               G           D        G
     You are the peace in my troubled sea.

[V2]
.G                 C         G
 In the silence You won't let go,
.C      G              D
 in the questions Your truth will hold.

 Your great love will lead me through.

     You are the peace in my troubled sea.

 My Lighthouse, my Lighthouse,

 shining in the darkness, I will follow You.
.C         G    Em       D
 My Lighthouse, my Lighthouse,
.C                   G
 I will trust the promise

 You will carry me safe to shore,

 safe to shore,
.         G
 safe to shore

.G                  C      G
 I won't fear what tomorrow brings,

 My God's love will lead me through.

     You are the peace in my troubled sea.

     You will lead us through the storms.</lyrics>
