[V1]
.D
 Who is this King of Glory?
.     G
 That pursues me with his love?

.D
 And haunts me with each hearing
.   G
 of His softly spoken words
[V1a]
.G
 My conscience a reminder,
.      Bm
 Of forgiveness that I need

.A                         G
 Who is this King of Glory?
.                 D
 who offers it to me?

[V2]
.D
 Who is this King of angels?
.  G
 O blessed Prince of Peace

.D
 Revealing things of Heaven
.    G
 And all its mysteries
[V2a]
.G
 My spirit's ever longing
.        Bm
 For His grace in which to stand

.A                         G
 Who is this King of glory?
.                      D
 Son of God and son of man

[C]
.D           G           Bm
 His name is Jesus, precious Jesus
.     A              G
 The Lord Almighty, King of my heart
.D
 King of glory.

[V3]
.D
 Who is this King of Glory?
.     G
 With strength and majesty

.D
 And wisdom beyond measure,
.    G
 The gracious King of kings
[V3a]
.G
 The Lord of Earth and Heaven,
.       Bm
 The Creator of all things

.A                       G
 He is the King of glory,
.                   D
 He's everything to me</lyrics>
