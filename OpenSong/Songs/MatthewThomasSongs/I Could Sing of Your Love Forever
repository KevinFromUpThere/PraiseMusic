.D                           Em
   Over the mountains and the sea
.                              G2
 Your river runs with love for me
.                      A
 And I will open up my heart
.                          D
 And let the healer set me free
.                       Em
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.                         G2
 And I will daily lift my hands
. 
 For I will always sing
.   A
 Of when your love came down

[C]
.D                       Em
    I could sing of your love forever
.G2                      A
    I could sing of your love forever
.D                       Em
    I will sing of your love forever
.G2                      A
    I will sing of your love forever

[B]
.Em                D
    Oh I feel like dancing
.G2                    A
    It's foolishness I know
.Em                        D
    But when the world has seen the light
.            G2
 They will dance with joy
.             A
 Like we're dancing now</lyrics></song>
