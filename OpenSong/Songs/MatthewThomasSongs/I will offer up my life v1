.D                  G
 I will offer up my life
.   A7sus4     Bm7
 In spirit and truth,
.                       G
 Pouring out the oil of love
.      A7sus4     D
 As my worship to You
.   D/F#             G       A     Bm7   
 In surrender I must give my every part;
.                       G
 Lord, receive the sacrifice  
.     A7sus4 D
 Of a broken heart

[C]
.       Bm         G     A7sus4     D
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.      Bm         G             A7sus4      D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.         Bm          G     A7sus4      D
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung
.     Bm             G    A7sus4                  D
 As a praise of Your name For the things You have done?
.                      Em7       D/F#    G   
 Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
.       Em7     D/F#         G
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.  A7sus4         D
 By this thankful heart
.G        A7sus4 

[V2]
.D                  G
 You deserve my every breath
.   A7sus4     Bm7
 For You've paid the great cost;
.                       G
 Giving up Your life to death,
.      A7sus4     D
 Even death on a cross
.   D/F#             G       A     Bm7   
 You took all my shame away,
.     A7sus4 D
 There defeated my sin
.                       G
 Opened up the gates of heaven
.      A7sus4     D
 And have beckoned me in</lyrics></song>
