[V1]
.D                               G        D
 Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
.                                   A7
 Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
.        D                      G
 Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
.        D             A7          D
 Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[C]
.      D             G
 Are you washed in the blood,
.       D                           A7
 In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
.         D                          G
 Are your garments spotless are they white as snow?
.        D             A7           D
 Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[V2]
.D                               G        D
 Are you walking daily by the saviour's side?
.                                   A7
 Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
.        D                      G
 Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
.        D             A7          D
 Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[V3]
.D                                      G         D
 When the Bridegroom cometh, will your robes be white?
.                                   A7
 Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?
.        D                      G
 Will your souls be ready for the mansions bright
.        D             A7          D
 And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

[V4]
.D                                  G          D
 Lay aside your garments that are stained with sin
.                                   A7
 And be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
.        D                      G
 There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean.
.        D             A7          D
 O, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!
