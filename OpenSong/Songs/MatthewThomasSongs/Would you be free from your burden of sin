[V1]
.D                           G         D
 Would you be free from your burden of sin
.        A                   D                 
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
.D                     G       D
 Would you o'er evil a victory win
.        A         A7           D G D A
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[C]
.         D      D7     G              D
 There is power, power, wonder working power
.       A            D   
 In the blood of the Lamb
.A        D      D7     G              D

 In the precious blood of the Lamb

 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
.D                     G       D
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide

 There's wonderful power in the blood

[V3]
.D                           G         D
 Would you be whiter much whiter than snow
.        A                   D                 
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
.D                     G       D
 Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow
.        A         A7           D G D A
 There's wonderful power in the blood
