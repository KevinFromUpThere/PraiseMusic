  <title>I Will Enter His Gates</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart;
 I will enter His courts with praise.
 I will say this is the day that the Lord has made.
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

[V2]
 He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad. 
 He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
 I will rejoice for He has made me glad. </lyrics>
