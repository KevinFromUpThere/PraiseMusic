  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em         C             G
 Water You turned into wine
.Em          C              G 
 Opened the eyes of the blind
.               Am7
 There's no one like You
.          D
 None like You

[V2]
.Em        C               G
 Into the darkness You shine
.Em          C          G
 Out of the ashes we rise
.                Am7
 There's no one like You
.          D
 None like You

[C]
.Em
 Our God is greater
.C
 Our God is stronger 
.G                       D/F#
 Lord You are higher than any other
.Em
 Our God is healer
.C
 Awesome in power
.     G        D
 Our God, Our God

[V3]
.Em        C               G
 Into the darkness You shine
.Em          C          G
 Out of the ashes we rise 
.               Am7
 There's no one like You
.          D
 None like You

[B]
.Em 
 And if our God is for us
.C
 Then who could ever stop us
.G
 And if our God is with us
.D/F# (D 2nd time)
 Then what could stand against
