[V1]
.D                        G
 What a friend we have in Jesus,
.D                           A
 All our sins and griefs to bear;
.D                   G
 What a privilege to carry,
.A                    D
 Everything to God in prayer!
.A                     D
 O what peace we often forfeit,
.G      D                A
 O what needless pain we bear;
.D                     G
 All because we do not carry,
.A                    D
 Everything to God in prayer!

[V2]
.D                      G
 Have we trials and temptations?
.D                   A
 Is there trouble anywhere?
.D                     G
 We should never be discouraged,
.A                      D
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.
.A                       D3
 Can we find a friend so faithful?
.G        D               A
 Who will all our sorrows share?
.D                     G
 Jesus knows our every weakness;
.A                      D
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.

[V3]
.D                     G
 Are we weak and heavy laden,
.D                       A
 Cumbered with a load of care?
.D                          G
 Precious Saviour still our refuge;
.A                      D
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.
.A                         D
 Do your friends despise, forsake you?
.G       D              A
 Take it to the Lord in prayer!
.D                          G
 In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield you;
.A                       D
 You will find a solace there.</lyrics>
