[V1]
.G        D            A     D
 Down the mountain the river flows
.       G         D             A       D
 and it brings re-freshing wher-ever it goes.
.G           D           A        D
 Through the valleys and over the fields
.    G       D                A        D
 the river is rushing and the river is here.

[C]
.    D                     G        D
 The river of God sets our feet a - dancing,
.    D                      A           D
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer.
.    D                      G           D
 The river of God fills our mouths with laughter,
.    G     D             A        D
 and we re-joice for the river is here

[V2]
.    G        D      A            D
 The river of God is teeming with life
.    G       D            A     D
 And all who touch it can be re-vived.
.    G         D         A        D
 And those who linger on this riv-er's shore
.     G         D             A           D
 Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord.

[V3]
.   G      D           A       D
 Up to the mountain we love to go
.   G        D        A      D
 To find the presence of the Lord
.  G        D            A         D
 A-long the banks of the river we run,
.   G             D            A             D
 We dance with laughter giving praise to the Son.</lyrics>
