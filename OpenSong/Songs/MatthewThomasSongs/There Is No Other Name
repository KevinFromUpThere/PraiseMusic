  <lyrics>[C]
.G                 D
 There is no other name
.         Em         C
 By which man can be saved
.         G        D          C  G/B Am7 G
 There is no other name under heaven

.         G           D
 There is rest for my soul
.        Em           C
 And the wounded made whole
.        G            D           C  G/B Am7 G
 And the captives set free and forgiven

[V]
.C    D             G
 Such love as I had never known
.C    D            G                    Em
 I've found in the grace that flowed to me
.      C
 In my unrighteousness
.Am             D
 This is why my heart and soul and tongue confess</lyrics>
