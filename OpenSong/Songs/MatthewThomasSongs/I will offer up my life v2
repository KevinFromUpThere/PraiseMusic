[V1]
.D      D/F#        G
 I will offer up my life
.   A               D
 In spirit and truth,
.        D/F#           G
 Pouring out the oil of love
.      A              D
 As my worship to You
.   D/F#             G       A           D
 In surrender I must give my every part;
.      D/F#             G
 Lord, receive the sacrifice  
.     A            D
 Of a broken heart

[C]
.                  G     A          D
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.                 G             A        D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.                    G     A           D
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung
.                    G
 As a praise of Your name
.        A               D
 For the things You have done?
.                      Em    D/F#        G     
 Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
.       Em      D/F#         G
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.  A                D
 By this thankful heart

[V2]
.D      D/F#        G
 You deserve my every breath
.   A                         D
 For You've paid the great cost;
.        D/F#           G
 Giving up Your life to death,
.      A              D
 Even death on a cross
.   D/F#             G       A           D
 You took all my shame away, There defeated my sin
.      D/F#             G
 Opened up the gates of heaven
.      A              D
 And have beckoned me in</lyrics>
