[V1]
.G                                 C                         
 God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,                    
.           G                  C   D7
 He came to love, heal, and forgive;                         
.             G    G7        C                               
 He lived and died to buy my pardon;                         
.         G                 D7              G 
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.           

[C]
.           G                   C
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
.           G                  D7
 Because He lives, all fear is gone;
.          G D G                C
 Because I know___ He holds the future,
.            G                D7              G
 And life is worth the living just because He lives.

[V2]
.G                           C                               
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby                            
.             G                C   D7
 and feel the pride and joy he gives;                        
.            G                C                              
 But greater still the calm assurance                        
.               G              D7              G            
 This child can face uncertain days because He lives.        

[V3]
.G                                C                          
 And then one day I'll cross that river;                     
.                  G              C   D7
 I'll fight life's final war with pain;                      
.            G                  C                            
 And then as death gives way to vict'ry,                     
.             G               D7               G             
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.
