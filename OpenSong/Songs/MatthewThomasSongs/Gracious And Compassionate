  <lyrics>[V1]
.         G                      D         G
    The Lord is gracious and compassionate
.C                      G          
    Slow to anger, and rich in love (X2)
  
[B]
.Em                  C
    And the Lord is good to all
.           G
    He has compassion
.                    D
    On all that he has made

[C]
.G                         D
    As far as the east is from the west 
.              C
    That's how far 
.                             G
    He has removed our transgressions from us (x2)
 
[V2]
.G             D           C
    Praise the Lord, Oh my soul
.               G
    Praise the Lord  (repeat)
