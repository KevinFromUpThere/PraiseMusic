  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                 G        D
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.D            G         D     A
 On which the Prince of glory died,
.D                 G         D
 My richest gain I count but loss,
.D           A               D
 And pour contempt on all my pride.

[V2]
.D                       G       D
 It's midnight, and from all removed
.D            G        D        A
 The Saviour wrestles lone with fears
.D                G     D
 E’en the disciple whom He loved
.D                    A       D
 Heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.

[V3]
.D                      G          D
 It's midnight, and for others’ guilt
.D          G          D       A
 The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;
.D                      G      D
 Yet He Who has in anguish knelt
.D                    A      D
 Is not forsaken by His God.

[V4]
.D                      G          D
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
.D          G          D       A
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
.D                      G      D
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
.D                    A      D
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

[V5]
.D                       G       D
 Were the whole realm of Nature mine,
.D            G        D        A
 That were an offering far too small;
.D                G     D
 Love so amazing, so divine,
.D                    A       D
 Demands my soul, my life, my all!
