  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                            Am  D
 Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
.D                         G
 Face to face-what will it be,
.                     Am    Am7
 When with rapture I behold Him,
.      G          D7       G
 Jesus Christ Who died for me?

[C]
.D                      G
 Face to face I shall behold Him,
.A     A7              D   D7
 Far beyond the starry sky;
.G                       Am
 Face to face in all His glory,
.        G          D7  G
 I shall see Him by and by!

[V2]
.G                  Am    D
 Only faintly now I see Him,
.D                         G
 With the darkening veil between,
.                     Am
 But a bless√®d day is coming,
.      G          D7       G
 When His glory shall be seen.

[V3]
.G                     Am    D
 What rejoicing in His presence,
.D                         G
 When are banished grief and pain;
.                     Am
 When the crooked ways are straightened,
.      G          D7       G
 And the dark things shall be plain.

[V4]
.G                         Am  D
 Face to face-oh, blissful moment!
.D                         G
 Face to face-to see and know;
.                     Am
 Face to face with my Redeemer,
.      G          D7       G
 Jesus Christ Who loves me so.</lyrics>
