  <lyrics>[V1]
.           D              A                 G                 D
 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
.           D            A                 G                D
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.
.         D              A               G               D
 Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;
.           D                 A                G             D
 While I sing the countless treasure of my God's unchanging love.

[V2]
.       D             A             G                   D
 Here I raise mine Ebenezer, Hither by Thy help I come;
.      D                A                G            D
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.
.      D                A                   G                D
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
.      D              A            G                  D
 He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.

[V3]
.     D                 A             G                  D
 O to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;
.        D                A               G                  D
 Let Thy grace now, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
.         D              A                 G               D
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
.          D                  A                G               D
 Here's my heart, Oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.</lyrics>
