[V1]
.D
 How good is the God we adore,
.    A                     D
 Our faithful unchangeable Friend!
.D                          A
 His love is as great as His power,
.    G               A         D
 And knows neither measure nor end!

[V2]
.D
 It's Jesus the First and the Last,
.      A                          D
 Whose Spirit shall Guide us safe home,
.D                                A
 We’ll praise Him for all that is past,
.    G             A             D
 And trust Him for all that’s to come.</lyrics>
