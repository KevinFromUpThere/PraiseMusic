[V1]
.G                          D                   G
 I hear the Saviour say,“Thy strength indeed is small;
.         Em7                  C            G        D       G
 Child of weakness, watch and pray,Find in Me thine all in all.”

[C]
.G             Em7   G            D
 Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
.G                G/B    C2        G         D         G
 Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

[V2]
.      G                     D                 G
 Lord, now indeed I find Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,
.    Em7                  C        G        D         G
 Can change the leper’s spots And melt the heart of stone.

[V3]
.    G                         D             G
 And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete,
.     Em7              C         G       D       G
 Jesus died, my soul to save, my lips shall still repeat.

[P]
.G                G/B    C2        G         D         G
 Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
.    G         D         G
 He washed it white as snow.

[B]
.  G              G/B  C
 O praise the One who paid my debt
.G/B  Am7              G/B   C
 And raised this life up from the dead

.  G              G/B  C
 O praise the One who paid my debt
.G/B  Am7              G/B   C
 And raised this life up from the dead</lyrics>
