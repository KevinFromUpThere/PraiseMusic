[V1]
.    C         G           D       Em
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
.C            G            D     Em
 It's time to sing Your song again.
.C            G              D           Em
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
.C2         G                Dsus4 D  G   Gsus4 G
 Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.


[C]
.          C          G
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
.D/F# Em
 O my soul,
.C             G    Dsus4 D
 Worship His holy name.

 Sing like never before,

 0 my soul.

 I'll worship Your holy name.


[V2]
.       C       G                D        Em
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
.      C       G               D         Em
 Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
.    C        G                D       Em
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
.C2           G              Dsus4 D  G    Gsus4 G
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.


[V3]
.    C       G           D            Em
 And on that day when my strength is failing,
.    C         G            D         Em
 The end draws near, and my time has come;
.C        G                   D        Em
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
.C2           G                 Dsus4  D  G  Gsus4 G
 Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!

.          C            D       G
 Yes, I'll worship Your holy name.</lyrics>
