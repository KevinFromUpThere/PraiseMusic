  <title>More Than Conquerors</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 
. [C]       [G]
 When my hope and strength is gone
. [C]       [G]
 You're the one who calls me on
. [C]       [G]
 You are the life
. [C]       [G]
 You are the fight
.     [D]      [G]
 That's in my soul
 
 
[V2]
 
. [C]       [G]
 Oh, Your resurrection power
. [C]       [G]
 Burns like fire in my heart
. [C]       [G]
 When waters rise
. [C]       [G]
 I lift my eyes
.   [D]         [G]
 Up to Your throne
 
 
[C]
 
.[Em]   [C]              [G ]              [D]
 We are more than conquerors, through Christ
.[Em]   [C]              [G ]              [D]
 You have overcome this world, this life
.[Em]              [C]    
 We will not bow to sin or to shame
.[G ]              [D]
 We are defiant in Your name
.[Em]              [C]
 You are the fire that cannot be tamed
.[G ]              [D]
 You are the power in our veins
.  [Em]         [C]            [G]
 Our Lord, our God, our Conqueror
 
 
[V3]
 
. [C]       [G]
 I will sing into the night
. [C]       [G]
 Christ is risen and on high
. [C]       [G]
 Greater is He
. [C]       [G]
 Living in me
.     [D]      [G]
 Than in the world
 
 
[V4]
 
. [C]       [G]        
 No surrender, no retreat
. [C]       [G]
 We are free and we're redeemed
. [C]       [G]
 We will declare
. [C]       [G]
 Over despair
.     [D]      [G]
 You are the hope
 
 
[B]
 
.[Em]           [C]
 Nothing is impossible
.[Em]           [C]
 Every chain is breakable
.     [G]     [C]     [Em]   [D]
 With You, we are victorious
.[Em]           [C]
 You are stronger than our hearts
.[Em]           [C]
 You are greater than the dark
.     [G]     [C]     [Em]   [D]
 With You, we are victorious (x2)</lyrics>
