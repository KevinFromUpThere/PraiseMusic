  <lyrics>[V1]
.        [C]                                    [F]            [C]
 Your mercy reigns from Heaven, like confetti at a wedding
.        [F]                [C]              [G]
 And I am celebrating in the downpour
.        [C]                                    [F]            [C]
 Your heart is wild with color like a never ending summer,
.        [F]               [C]       [G]                    [C]
 you burn away the winter of my cold and weary heart.

[C]
.     [C]      [F] [C]   [G]
 My soul cries out holy holy, 
.     [C]      [F] [C]   [G]
 My heart is lost in your beauty
.     [C]      [F] [C]   [G]
 All hope is found in your mercy, 
.     [C]      [F]
 You paid the price 
.  [C] [G]          [C]
 Now I am finally free


[V2]
.        [C]                                    [F]            [C]
 Your grace oh God’s the anchor, that’s holding me forever
.        [F]                [C]              [G]
 Come trouble or high water, I am steadfast
.        [C]                                    [F]            [C]
 Yeah you lift me when I’m sinking, like the swell of mighty oceans
.        [F]               [C]       [G]                    [C]
 The power of redemption, it gives me wings to soar


[V3]
.        [C]                                    [F]            [C]
 We’ll cast our crowns before him, like the rustling leaves of autumn
.        [F]               [C]       [G]                    [C]
 Now every chain lies broken, and finally we’re free</lyrics>
