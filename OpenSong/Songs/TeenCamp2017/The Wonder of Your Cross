[V1]
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4
 The wonder of your cross shall be our meditation
.G        Am         C                  D       G/sus4
 To gather in that shadow when the sun went down
.D           D/E      D                       Em
 To weep with those who thought that you were leaving,
.            C
 You were leaving, Jesus
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4/G
 The humble King who never wore an earthly crown.


[V2]
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4
 To steal away at night when they took down your body.
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4
 With love and tears to leave You in a borrowed grave
.D           D/E      D                     Em
 To go with Mary to the place they laid You,
.            C
 Where they laid You, Jesus
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4/G
 And in the morning find the stone was rolled away


[C]
.     C           G          D
 The cross, O the wonderful cross
.     C           G          D
 What Glory, what victory, I've found
.     C           G          D
 I'll come to the wonderful cross
.       Em    C     | D     G/sus4/G
 And my whole life I lay down

[V3]
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4
 Were heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness?
.G        Am         C                  D        G/sus4
 Your Holy Spirit brooding round that empty throne?
.D           D/E      D              Em
 Until the declaration "He is Risen",
.            C
 You are risen, Jesus,
.G        Am         C                  D       G/sus4/G
 "He is not dead, behold He lives for evermore".</lyrics>
