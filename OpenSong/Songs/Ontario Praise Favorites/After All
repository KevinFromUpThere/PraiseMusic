[V1]
.[G]            [Em]            [C]                    [D]
 I can't comprehend your infinitely beautiful and perfect love
.[G]            [Em]            [C]                    [D]
 Oh I've dreamed dreams of majesty as brilliant as a billion stars
.                   [C]                [D]
 But they're never bright enough after all
 
 
[C]
.               [Em]   [C]    [G]   [D]
 Ho-ly,
 You are ho-ly
 You are ho-ly
.      [C]
 Holy
 
 
[V2]
 
.[G]            [Em]            [C]                    [D]
 I will sing a song for you my God with everything I have in me
.[C]                     [D]
 But it's never loud enough after all
 
 
[B]
 
.[C]            [G]                           [Em]     [D]
 Heaven and earth are full, full of your glory, glory
.[C]            [G]                           [Em]     [D]
 My soul it overflows full of your glory, your glory
.[C]            [G]                           [Em]     [D]
 Oh blessed is he who reigns, full of your glory, your glory
.[C]            [G]                           [Em]     [D]
 My cup, it can't contain all of your glory, your glory
.[C]               [G]          [D]
 Hosanna we are found after all you are
