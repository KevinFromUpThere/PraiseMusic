  <title>Swing Low &amp; There's A Land</title>
  <lyrics>[C1]
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Coming for to carry me home,
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Coming for to carry me home.
 
[V1]
 There's a land that is fairer than day,
 And by faith I can see it afar,
 For the Saviour waits over the way.
 To prepare us a dwelling place there.
 
[C2]
 In the sweet by and by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore
 In the sweet by and by
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore

[V2]
 To our bountiful Father above
 We will offer our tribute of praise,
 For the glorious gift of His love
 And the blessing that hall our days.
 
[V3]
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore
 The melodious songs of the blessed
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest</lyrics>
