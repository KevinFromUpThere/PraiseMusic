  <lyrics>[c]
 For the gift Thou gavest,
 Thy Son from Heaven above
 We thank Thee Lord 
 We praise Thee Lord
 Thou God of matchless love
 
[v1]
 Through Him our sacrifices
 Acceptable will be
 Though not of earthly gifts received
 We tender unto Thee
 
[v2]
 To sacrifice of praises
 That unto Thee ascends
 His blessed name and person
 An incense-fragrance lends
 
[v3]
 We praise Thee and we worship
 Thou great all-loving One
 For giving up Thy Son to death
 For sins which we had done
 
[v4]
 His death and resurrection
 Have brought us nigh to Thee
 Now with our hearts adoring
 To Thee we bow the knee
 
[c2]
 Amen</lyrics></song>
