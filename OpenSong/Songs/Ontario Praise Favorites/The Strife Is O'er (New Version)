  <title>The Strife Is O'er (New Version)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 The strife is o'er, the battle done, 
 The triumph of Jehovah won;
 Oh, let the song of praise be sung,

[V2]
 The powers of death have done their worst,
 Christ Jesus hath His foes dispersed;
 Let shouts of praise and joy outburst,

[V3]
 On that third day He rose again
 In glorious majesty to reign;
 Oh, let us swell the joyful strain,

[V4]
 He overcame the power of hell,
 The bars from heaven's high portals fell; 
 Let songs of joy His triumph tell

[V5]
 He died upon Golgotha's tree,
 From death's dread sting to set us free, 
 That we, O God, may sing to Thee
 
[C]
 Hallelujah!
