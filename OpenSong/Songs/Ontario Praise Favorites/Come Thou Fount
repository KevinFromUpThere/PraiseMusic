[V1]
.           G              D                 C                 G
 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
.           G            D                 C                G
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.
.         G              D               C               G
 Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;
.           G                 D                C             G
 Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, Mount of Thy redeeming love.

[V2]
.       G             D             C                   G
 Here I raise mine Ebenezer, Hither by Thy great help I come;
.      G                D                C            G
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.
.      G                D                   C                G
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
.      G              D            C                  G
 He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.

[V3]
.      G                 D             C                  G
 Oh to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;
.        G                D               C                  G
 Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
.         G              D                 C               G
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
.          G                  D                C               G
 Here's my heart, Oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.</lyrics>
