  <title>The Master Died Upon A Cross Of Shame</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 The Master died upon a cross of shame;
 There we were crucified.
 May we be true to HIs most blessed Name
 And with Him close abide
 
[C]
 O Lord, our Lord, we would acknowledge Thee
 In all we say and do
 By Thing atoning death from sin set free,
 We would to Thee be true
 
[V2]
 Around this simple emblem of a grave
 We stand, to keep His word,
 Who once was buried in a hewn-out cave,
 Our risen, sovereign Lord.
 
[V3]
 As buried thus with him with whom we died,
 WE would more like Him grow;
 In all our ways be really sanctified,
 And Him more truly know.
 
[V4]
 Since now in Christ we're raised from the dead,
 Our eyes upon the throne,
 O may our thoughts aspire to Him our Head,
 And worldly claims disown!</lyrics>
