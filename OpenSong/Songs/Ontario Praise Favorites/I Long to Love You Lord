[v3]
 I long to love You, Lord
 Much more than I do.
 I long to love You, Lord
 Much more than I do.
 And learn to seek your face,
 And the knowledge of Your grace,
 I long to love You,
 Lord.
 
 Birds in the sky
 Sing their songs to You.
 And the trees in the field
 Lift their arms to You.
 And I want to sing to You,
 And I want to lift my arms to You,
 Lord.</lyrics>
