  <lyrics>[v1]
 There is no name so sweet on earth,
 No name so sweet in Heaven,
 The Name, before His wondrous birth
 To Christ the Savior given.
 
[c]
 We love to sing of Christ our King,
 And hail Him, blessèd Jesus;
 For there’s no word ear ever heard
 So dear, so sweet as “Jesus.”
 
[v2]
 And when He hung upon the tree,
 They wrote this Name above Him;
 That all might see the reason we
 Forevermore must love Him.
 
[v3]
 So now, upon His Father’s throne,
 Almighty to release us
 From sin and pain, He gladly reigns,
 The Prince and Savior, Jesus.
 
[v4]
 Lord Jesus! by that matchless Name,
 Thy grace shall fail us never;
 Today as yesterday the same,
 Thou art the same forever!
