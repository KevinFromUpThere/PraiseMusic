  <lyrics>[v1]
 When He cometh, when He cometh
 To make up His jewels,
 All His jewels, precious jewels,
 His loved and His own.

[c]
 Like the stars of the morning,
 His brightness adorning,
 They shall shine in their beauty,
 Bright gems for His crown.

[v2]
 He will gather, He will gather
 The gems for His kingdom;
 All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
 His loved and His own.

[v3]
 Little children, little children,
 Who love their Redeemer,
 Are the jewels, precious jewels,
 His loved and His own.</lyrics></song>
