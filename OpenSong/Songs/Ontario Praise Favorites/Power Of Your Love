 Lord, I come to You, let my heart be changed, renewed,

 Flowing from the grace, That I found in You;

 Lord, I've come to know, the weaknesses I see in me,

 Will be stripped away, By the power of Your love.

 And I will soar with You, Your Spirit leads me on,

 In the power of Your love.

 In living every day, In the power of Your love.
