  <lyrics>;Key: F (E capo 1)

[v1]
.         E                             A
 When the weight of the world begins to fall
.       E                    A
 On the Name of Jesus I will call
.      E                 A
 For I know my God is in control
.        E          A
 and His purpose is unshakable

[c]
. E                     B
 Doesn't matter what I feel
.                      C#m7
 Doesn't matter what I see
.   B         A
 My hope will always be
.        B           E
 In Your promises to me
.                        B
 Now I'm casting out all fear
.                         C#m7
 for Your love has set me free
.   B         A
 My hope will always be
.        B           E
 In Your promises to me

[v2]
.     E                     A
 As I walk into the days to come
.       E                        A
 I will not forget what You have done
.        E                      A
 For you have supplied my every need
.         E                      A
 and Your presence is enough for me

[b]
.         A                   E          B
 You will always be more than enough for me
.         A                   E          B
 You will always be more than enough for me
. A                    E
 Nothing's gonna stop the plans You've made
. B                    C#m
 Nothing's gonna take Your love away
.         A         E                    B
 You will always be more than enough for me
