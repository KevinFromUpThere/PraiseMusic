.           D         G    D
 Before the throne of God above
.                            F#m
 I have a strong and perfect plea
.             G            A       Bm
 A great High Priest whose name is love
.         G                    D
 Who ever lives and pleads for me
[c1]
.           G      D      A
 My name is graven on His hands
.           G              Bm
 My name is written on His heart
.            G        A          Bm
 I know that while in heaven He stands
.              G               Bm
 No tongue can bid me thence depart
.              G              D
 No tongue can bid me thence depart

[v2]
.           D         G     D
 When satan tempts me to despair
.                              F#m
 And tells me of the guilt within
.         G        A       Bm
 Upward I look and see Him there
.            G             D
 Who made an end to all my sin
[c2]
.            G       D       A
 Because the sinless Saviour died
.          G               Bm
 My sinful soul is counted free
.            G       A    Bm
 For God the just is satisfied
.           G              Bm
 To look on Him and pardon me
.           G              D
 To look on Him and pardon me

---
[v3]
.           D          G     D
 Behold him there! The risen Lamb
.                             F#m
 My perfect spotless righteousness
.             G     A     Bm
 The great unchangeable I AM
.            G            D
 The King of glory and of grace
[c3]
.             G        D   A
 One with Himself I cannot die
.           G                  Bm
 My soul is purchased with His blood .
.           G        A         Bm
 My life is hid with Christ on high
.               G              Bm
 With Christ my Saviour and my God
.               G              D
 With Christ my Saviour and my God
