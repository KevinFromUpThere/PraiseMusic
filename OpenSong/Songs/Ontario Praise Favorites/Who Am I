[v1]
.              G              D/F#                Em               D                         C
 Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth would care to know my name,
.              D/C                 C
 Would care to feel my hurt?
.              G              D/F#                         Em               D                         C
 Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star would choose to light the way
.              D/C                 C
 For my ever wand'ring heart?

.         C                         D           C/E                                D/F#
 Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done.
.            C/E                         D/F#          C                           D
 Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are.

.G        D/F#                Em               D                         C 
 I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
.     D                             C                   D        
 A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.
.G        D/F#                Em               D                         C  
 Still You hear me when I'm calling. Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.
.                     D                    C             G        C        Em
 And You've told me who I am; I am Yours. I am Yours.
 
[v2]
.              G              D/F#                Em               D                         C
 Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin would look on me with love
.              D/C                 C 
 And watch me rise again?
.              G              D/F#                Em               D                         
 Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea would callout through the rain
.              D/C                 C
 And calm the storm in me?
