  <lyrics>[v1]
 Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice;
 You became nothing, poured out to death.
 Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life,
 And I'm in that place once again, 
 I'm in that place once again.
 
[c1]
 And once again I look upon 
 the cross where You died.
 I'm humbled by Your mercy
 and I'm broken inside.
 Once again I thank You, 
 Once again I pour out my life.
 
[v2]
 Now You are exalted to the highest place,
 King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.
 But for now, I marvel at this saving grace
 And I'm full of praise once again, 
 I'm full of praise once again
 
[C2]
 Thank You for the cross,
 Thank You for the cross,
 Thank You for the cross, 
 My Friend.
 (Repeat)
