  <lyrics>[v1]
 Above all power, above all kings
 Above all nature and all created things
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
 You were there before the world began
 
[v2]
 Above all kingdoms above all thrones
 Above all wonders the world has ever known
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
 There’s no way to measure what You’re worth
 
[c]
 Crucified, and laid behind a stone
 You lived to die rejected and alone
 Like a rose trampled on the ground
 You took the fall, and thought of me
 Above all
 </lyrics></song>
