  <lyrics>[V1]
.D       A         Em      G
 The walls are high, the walls are strong
.D                          A               Em                   G
 I’ve been locked in this castle, that I’ve built for far too long
.D                  A        Em              G
 But You have surrounded me, a sea on every side
.D                 A           Em                    G
 Now the cracks are forming and I’ve got no place to hide
[C]
.D       A         Em                          G
 Now I see, now I see the walls I’ve built are falling
.         D                  A            Em      G
 And Your waves of grace are washing over me
.D       A         Em                          G
 Now I see, now I see the walls I’ve built are falling
.D                  A                  Em      G
 Waves of grace are washing over me
[V2]
 My heart’s been hard, I have been blind
 I have often tried so hard to keep you from my mind
 I have lived my life, a castle built on sand
 But I want You to reign Lord, take me by the hand
[V3]
 Lord please reign in every part
 I give my life to You, I open up my heart
 I want to be like You, I want to seek your face
 Lord please wash me in Your awesome waves of grace
 
;For JUST PRAISE II - Greame will do his TALKY BIT at the end, rest of band to cycle chords and then REPEAT CHORUS after he's done.  Maybe twice.
