  <title>Hallelujah (David Woods Rendition)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 We'll sing a song to a borrowed tune,

 Lift high our voice, sing praise to you,
 
 For all you've done to save us, for your glory.
 
 Once dead in sin, you gave us life,

 Through Christ your Son, who gave his life
 
 So we could sing eternal hallelujahs.

 
[C]
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 (repeat)

[V2]
 
 No greater gift we've ever known
 
 The One who came from the Father's throne
 
 To bring rebellious sinners into glory.

 He suffered for us on the tree,

 He gave his life, to set us free

 From sin and death, to reign with him forever!



[V3]

 His body was laid in a borrowed tomb,

 But death would be beaten so very soon,

 He'd rise again, to bring God's sons to glory.

 The life we live is lived in him,

 No height, no depth, no power, no thing,

 Can separate us from his love, forever.
