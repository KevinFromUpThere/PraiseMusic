D                 G Here is Love vast as the Ocean.        D                A Loving kindness as the flood.        D                     G When the Prince of life, our ransom.        D         A       D Shed for us His precious blood.        D                 A Who His love will not remember?.        A7                D Who can cease to sing His praise.        Bm           G He can never be forgotten.        D             A      D Throughout Heaven's eternal days[v2]  On the Mount of Crucifixion Fountains opened deep and wide Through the floodgates of God's mercy Flowed a vast and gracious tide Grace and love, like mighty rivers Poured incessant from above And Heaven's peace and perfect justice Kissed a guilty world in love[v3] Let us all His love accepting Love Him ever all our days Let us seek His kingdom only And our lives be to His praise He alone shall be our glory Nothing in the world we see He has cleansed and sanctified us He Himself set us free[v4] In His truth He does direct me By His spirit through His Word And His grace my need is meeting As I trust in Him, my Lord All His fullness He is pouring In His love and power in me Without measure, full and boundless As I yield myself to Thee</lyrics>  <hymn_number></hymn_number></song>
