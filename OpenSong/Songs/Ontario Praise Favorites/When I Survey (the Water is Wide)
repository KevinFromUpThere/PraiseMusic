.D            G            D	
 When I survey the wondrous cross 
.             Bm        G    Em   A
 on which the Prince of Glory died; 
.    F#m               Bm   G  Em
 my richest gain I count but loss, 
.         D G Em      A     D
 and pour contempt on all my pride. 
 
[v2]
.           D         G        D	
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 
.	       Bm      G         Em    A
 save in the death of Christ, my God; 
.	        F#m       Bm       G  Em
 all the vain things that charm me most, 
.	 D G Em   A      D
 I sacrifice them to His blood. 
 
[v3]
.              D        G          D	
 See, from His head, His hands, His feet, 
.	    Bm   G           Em   A
 sorrow and love flow mingled down. 
.	       F#m      Bm     G Em
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
.	    D G   Em   A      D
 or thorns compose so rich a crown. 
 
[v4]
.               D       G      D	
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
.	       Bm     G        Em   A
 that were an offering far too small; 
.       F#m   Bm      G Em
 love so amazing, so divine, 
.	    D  G Em A         D
 demands my soul, my life, my all.
