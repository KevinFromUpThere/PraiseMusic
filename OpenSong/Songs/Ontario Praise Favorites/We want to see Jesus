  <lyrics>[v]
 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
 A banner that flies across this land,
 That all men might see the truth and know
 He is the way to heaven.
 (Repeat)
 
[c]
 We want to see, we want to see,
 We want to see Jesus lifted high.
 We want to see, we want to see,
 We want to see Jesus lifted high.
 
[c2]
 Step by step we're moving forward,
 Little by little taking ground,
 Every prayer a powerful weapon,
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
 And down, and down, and down.
