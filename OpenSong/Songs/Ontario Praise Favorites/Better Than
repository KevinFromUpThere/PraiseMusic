  <lyrics>[v1]
 Your love is better than all things
 Your love is better than all things
 And I don’t have the strength of words 
 to tell you truly how I feel
 
[v2]
 Your love is better than life
 Your love is better than life
 And I don’t have the strength of words 
 to tell you truly how I feel
 
[c]
 My God, you are the only one for me,
 The only one for me
 My God your love is better than all other loves 
 And now you’re drawing me
 And I just want to be
 Closer to you
