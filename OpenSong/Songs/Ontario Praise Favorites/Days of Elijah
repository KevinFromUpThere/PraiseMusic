  <lyrics>[v1]
 These are the days of Elijah
 Declaring the Word of the Lord
 And these are the days of your servant Moses
 Righteousness being restored
 
[v2]
 And though these are days of great trials
 Of famine and darkness and sword
 Still we are the voice in the desert crying 
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord
 
[c]
 Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
 Shining like the Sun, at the trumpet call
 Lift your voice, Year of Jubilee
 Out of Zionâ€™s hill salvation comes
 
[v3]
 These are the days of Ezekiel
 The dry bones becoming as flesh
 And these are the days of your servant David
 Rebuilding the Temple of Praise
 
[v4]
 And these are the days of the harvest
 The fields are white in Your world
 And we are the laborers in Your Vineyard
 Declaring the Word of the Lord
