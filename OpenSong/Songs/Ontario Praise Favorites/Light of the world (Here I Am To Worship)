[V1]
.D            A                  G
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness,
.D         A            G
 Opened my eyes, let me see;
.D           A         G
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
.D         A               G 
 Hope of a life spent with You.
 
[C]
.(B7)         D                     A 
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,
.             Bm                  G 
 Here I am to say that You're my God;
.                  D                  A 
 You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
.           Bm        G
 Altogether wonderful to me.
 
[V2]
.D           A           G
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
.D           A      G
 Glorious in Heaven above;
.D          A           G
 Humbly You came to the earth You created,
.D              A           G
 All for loveâ€™s sake became poor.

[B]
.           A   D        G
 And I'll never know how much it cost
.   A/C#   D/F# G        Asus4/G
 To see my sin upon that cross.  ______ x2</lyrics>
