  <lyrics>[v1]
 I will celebrate, sing unto the lord. 
 I will sing to Him a new song. 
 I will celebrate, sing unto the lord. 
 I will sing to Him a new song.
 
[v2]	 
 I will praise Him 
 For He has triumphed victoriously
 I will praise Him 
 For He has triumphed victoriously
 
[v3]
 I will celebrate, sing unto the lord. 
 I will sing to Him a new song. 	( 2 x's ) 
 		 
 I will praise Him 
 For He has triumphed victoriously (2 x's )
