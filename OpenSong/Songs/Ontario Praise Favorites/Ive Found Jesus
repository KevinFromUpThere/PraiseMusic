.        E
 Well, I hear they're singing in the streets 
.     A
 That Jesus is alive,
.    E
 And all creation shouts aloud 
.      A
 That Jesus is alive;
.      E
 Now surely we can all be changed 
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive;
.     E
 And everybody here can know
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.

.   C#m7
 And I will live for all my days 
.A             E                  B
 to raise a banner of truth and light,
.   C#m7                          A
 To sing about my Saviour's love
.         E
 And the best thing that happened
.        B
 Was the day I met You.

.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus.

[V2]
.        E
 Well, I feel like dancing in the streets
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
.     E
 To join with all who celebrate
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.
.      E
 The joy of God is in this town 
.      A
'cause Jesus is alive;
.     E
 for everybody's seen the truth
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.

.         C#m7
 Well, you lifted me from where I was,
.A                        F#m7                             A
 set my feet upon a rock-humbled that you even know about me.
.   C#m7                         A
 Now I have chosen to believe,-be-lieving that you've chosen me;
.F#m7                           A
 I was lost but now I've found.....</lyrics>
