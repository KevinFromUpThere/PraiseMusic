[V1]
 At the name of Jesus every knee will bow
 And every tongue confess Him the King of Glory now
 Its the Fathers pleasure that we should call Him Lord                                    
 Here from the beginning was the mighty Word
 
[C1]
 We sing..
 Glory to the Lord on high
 Glory to the Son who came to earth to die
 Glory to the Spirit who lifts the name on high
 The Name of Jesus, The Name of Jesus
 
[V2]
 At His voice creation sprang at once to sight
 All the angel faces and all the hosts of light
 Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way
 All the heavenly order,  in their great array
 
[c2]
 We sing..
 Glory to the Lord on high
 Glory to the Son who came to earth to die
 Glory to the Spirit who lifts the name on high
 The Name of Jesus, The Name of Jesus
 The Name of Jesus, The Name of Jesus
 
[V3]
 In Your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue
 All that is not holy,   all that is not true
 Crown Him as Your Captain, in temptations hour
 Let His will enthrall You, in its light and power
