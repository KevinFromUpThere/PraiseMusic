[v1]
.G                                    C2
 We face the trials this world will wage
.                                      G
 We pray for strength, to stand in faith
.                         C2
 Through it all our God remains
.G                                    C2
   We walk through sickness, hurt and pain
.                              G
 We pray for healing in Your name
.                         Dsus
 Through it all our God remains

[c]
.            G       Dsus  D
 Victorious, victorious
.      Am                       C  
 Jesus conquered the grave, and now He's alive
.  Dsus    D
 Inside of us

[v2]
.G                               C2
 We face the darkness, brave the fight,
.                                   G
 We stand with those who give their life
.                             C2
 Through it all our King will reign
.G                                 C2
 We walk through sorrow, grief and loss,
.                               G
 We see Your word turn weak to strong
.                                Dsus
 Through it all our King will reign

[c2]
.      G          Dsus D
 Victorious, victorious
.              Am                C
 We will stand for our King, the Savior who reigns
.    Dsus      D        G            D    Am   C
 In Jesus we are, victorious, whoa, whoa, whoa

[v3]
.G                                        C2
 You faced the trials, You chose the cross
.                                    B G
 Defeating death, You saved the lost
.                                  D
 And now we raise Your victory song
