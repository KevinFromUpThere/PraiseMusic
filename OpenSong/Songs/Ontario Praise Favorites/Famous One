  <lyrics>[c]
 You are the Lord,
 The famous one, the famous one
 Great is Your name upon the Earth
 The heavens declare
 You are glorious, glorious
 Great is Your fame beyond the Earth
 
[v1]
 And for all You've done and yet to do
 With every breath I'm praising You
 Desire of nations and every heart
 You alone are God, You alone are God
 
[v2]
 The morning star is shining through
 And every eye is watching You
 Revealed by nature and miracles,
 You are beautiful, You are beautiful </lyrics></song>
