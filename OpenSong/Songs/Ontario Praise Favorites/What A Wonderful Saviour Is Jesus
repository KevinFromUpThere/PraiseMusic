  <title>What A Wonderful Saviour Is Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 What a wonderful saviour is Jesus,
 What a wonderful friend is He.
 For He left all the glory of heaven,
 Came to Earth to die on Calvary
 
[C]
 Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,
 Sing hosanna to the King of Kings
 Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,
 Sing hosanna to the King
 
[V2]
 He arose from the grave, hallelujah!
 And He lives nevermore to die.
 At the Father's right hand interceding, 
 He will hear and heed our faintest cry.
 
[V3]
 He is coming some day to receive us,
 we'll be caught up to heaven above.
 What a joy it will be to behold Him;
 sing forever of his grace and love. </lyrics>
