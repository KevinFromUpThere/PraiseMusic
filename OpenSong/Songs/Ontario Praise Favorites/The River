  <lyrics>[v1]
.       E          A             E             B
 To the river I am going bringing sins I cannot bear
.         E                A                E                B
 Come and cleanse me, come forgive me Lord I need to meet you there
 
[v2]
.          E              A                 E             B
 In these waters, healing mercy flows with freedom from despair
.        E          A             E             B
 I am going, to that river Lord I need to meet you there
 
[c]
.          E          A         E              B
 Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care
.       E          A             E             B
 Take my hand now, lead me closer Lord I need to meet you there
 
[v3]
.          E               A               E          B
 Come and join us, in the river Come find life beyond compare
.       E            A             E                  B
 He is calling, He is waiting Jesus longs to meet you there
.       E            A             E                  B
 He is calling, He is waiting Jesus longs to meet you there
 
[c1]
.          E          A         E              B
 Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care
.       E          A             E             B
 Take my hand now, lead me closer Lord I need to meet you there
.       E          A             E             B
 Take my hand now, lead me closer Lord I need to meet you there
