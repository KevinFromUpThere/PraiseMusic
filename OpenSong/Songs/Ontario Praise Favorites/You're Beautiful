.D                  G
 I see Your face in every sunrise
.    Bm                         A
 The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
.D                        G
 The world awakens in the light of the day
.  Bm                     A
 I look up to the sky and say
.
 You’re beautiful

 I see Your power in the moonlit night
.      Bm                        A
 Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
.D                    G
 We are amazed in the light of the stars
.     Bm                      A
 It’s all proclaiming who You are

 I see you there hanging on a tree
.    Bm                                  A
 You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me
.D                           G
 Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
.Bm                        A
 Soon we will be coming home
.                  D G Bm A
 You’re beautiful,          You're beautiful

.D                 G
 When we arrive at eternity’s shore
.      Bm                         A
 Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
.D                     G
 We’ll enter in as the wedding bells ring
.    Bm                                 A
 Your bride will come together and we’ll sing
.                 D G Bm A                 D
 You’re beautiful,         You're beautiful,
