;Capo 2 When Em Start
.Am   G  F  C/E                    F
 Here I  am humbled by your Majesty
.C/E                          G/B  E/G#
 covered by your grace so free
.Am   G  F  C/E                     F
 Here I  am knowing I'm a sinful man
.C/E                             G/B  E/G#
 covered by the blood of the lamb

 since you laid down your life, the greatest sacrifice

 Majesty, Majesty
.       C                            G
 Your grace has found me just as I am
.      Am                            F
 empty handed but alive in your hands

[V2]
 Here I am, humbled by the love that you give
 Forgiven so that I can forgive
 Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire
 Sanctified by glory and fire


[C2]
 Majesty, Majesty
 Forever I am changed by Your love
 in the presence of your Majesty</lyrics></song>
