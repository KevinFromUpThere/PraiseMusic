[v1]
.G
 I want to scream it out
.
 From every mountain top
.C
 Your goodness knows no bounds
.
 Your goodness never stops
.Em
 Your mercy follows me
.
 Your kindness fills my life
.G                D
 Your love amazes me

[c]
.G
 I sing because You are good; And I dance because You are good
.D
 And I shout because You are good; You are good to me to me

[v2]
.G
 Nothing and no one comes
.
 Anywhere close to You
.C
 The earth and oceans deep
.
 Only reflect this truth
.Em
 And in my darkest night
.
 You shine as bright as day
.G                D
 Your love amazes me

[b]
.       Am7                    C
 With a cry of praise My heart will proclaim
.G                     D
 You are good, You are good
.       Am7                 C
 In the sun or rain My life celebrates
.        G             D
 You are good, You are good</lyrics></song>
