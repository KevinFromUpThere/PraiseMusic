  <lyrics>[v1]
 As Your children gather in peace
 All the angels sing in heaven.
 In Your temple all that I seek
 Is to glimpse Your holy presence.
 
[c1]
 All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord
 How much less to dwell in me?
 I can only make my one desire,
 Holding on to Thee.
 
[v2]
 All the angels exalt You on high
 What a kingdom to depart!
 But you left Your throne in the sky
 Just to live inside my heart.
 
[c2]
 I will always make my one desire,
 Holding on to Thee.
