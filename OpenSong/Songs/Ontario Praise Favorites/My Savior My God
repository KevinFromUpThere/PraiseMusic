  <lyrics>[v1]
 I am not skilled to understand
 What God has willed what God has planned
 I only know at His right hand 
 Stands one who is my Saviour
 
[v2]
 I take Him at His word and deed
 Christ died to save me, this I read
 And in my heart I find need
 Of Him who is my Saviour
 
[c1]
 That He would leave His place on high,
 And come for sinful man to die
 You count it strange; so once did I
 Before I knew my Saviour
 
[c2]
 My Saviour loves, My Saviour lives. 
 My Saviour`s always there for me.
 My God He was.  My God is always gonna be.
 My Saviour loves, My Saviour lives. 
 My Saviour`s always there for me.
 My God He was.  My God is always gonna be.
 
[v3]
 Yes living, dying let me bring
 My strength, my solace from this spring
 That He who lives to be my king
 Once died to be my Saviour</lyrics></song>
