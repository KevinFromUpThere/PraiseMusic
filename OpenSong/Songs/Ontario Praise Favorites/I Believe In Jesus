[V1]
.D G           A
 I  believe in Jesus,
.D            G             A
 I believe He is the Son of God;
.D            G        A
 I believe He died and rose again,
.D            G           A
 I believe He paid for us all.

[C]
.G2   A                  D                                 G
 And I believe that He's here now, (echo: I believe You're here,)
.A               D
 Standing in our midst;
.G2       A        D                                  G
 With the power to heal now, (echo: With the power to heal,)
.        A           D
 And the grace to forgive.

[V2]
.D G           A
 I  believe in you, Lord
.D            G             A
 I believe you are the Son of God;
.D            G        A
 I believe you died and rose again,
.D            G           A
 I believe you paid for us all.</lyrics>
