.Em                  C2
 Crown Him with many crowns
.    G/B           Dsus
 The Lamb upon His throne

 Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
.    D     A       Dsus
 All music but its own

 Awake, my soul and sing
.   A                Dsus - D
 Of Him who died for me
.    Em       Em/D   C2        G/B
 And hail Him as thy matchless King

 Through all eternity

 Let every throne, before Him fall

 Our God who reigns forevermore
