  <lyrics>[v1]
 Praise the Lord, from whom all blessings flow;
 He has washed and made me white as snow;
 
[v2]
 Iâ€™m redeemed from all my sin and shame
 Now and forever, Praise His Holy Name
 
[v3]
 Praise His Holy Name, Praise His Holy Name
 To God be the glory, now and forever;
 Praise His Holy Name
 </lyrics></song>
