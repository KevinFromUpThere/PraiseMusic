  <lyrics>[V1]
. D      D7        G         D          Bm      E           A  A7
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me;
.  D        D7       G       D          Bm        A     G   D 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.

[V2]
.     D          D7        G        D         Bm       E       A      A7
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;
.    D        D7       G       D        Bm     A       G      D 
 How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed!

[V3]
.        D    D7       G          D        Bm     E     A    A7
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come;
.     D          D7         G         D       Bm         A       G    D 
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.

[v4]
 The Lord has promised good to me.
 His word my hope secures.
 He will my shield and portion be,
 As long as life endures.

[v5]
 Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
 And mortal life shall cease,
 I shall possess within the veil,
 A life of joy and peace.



[V6]
.     D          D7        G        D            Bm      E      A   A7
 When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun;
.      D       D7      G          D           Bm        A       G   D 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun!
