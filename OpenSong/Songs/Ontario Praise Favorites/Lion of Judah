.           A                        D            A
1You're the Lion of Judah, the       Lamb Who was slain,
2There's a  shield in our hand and a sword at our side,
.                                  D              E
1You ascended to heaven and        evermore shall reign;
2There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be de___nied;
.       A                       D              A
1At the end of the age when the earth You re___claim,
2As the Father has told us for  these you have died,
.                              E
1You will gather the nations before You.||
2For the nations will gather before you.||
.                                                          D    E
1And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb Who was crucified,
2And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb Who was  crucified,
.                                                             D        E
1For with wisdom and mercy and justice He reigns at the       Father's side.
2Who went down to the grave yet was raised up to reign at the Father's side.

.        A                 D    A   E
 And the angels will cry, "Hail the Lamb
.        A                    D    A  E
 Who was slain for the world; rule in power!"
.        A                   D   A     E
 And the earth shall reply, "You shall reign
.       A                         D       E   A
 As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords!"</lyrics>
