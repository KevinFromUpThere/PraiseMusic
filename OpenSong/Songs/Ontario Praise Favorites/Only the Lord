  <lyrics>[c]
 Only the Lord is good,
 Only the Lord brings healing,
 Only the Lord is powerful and mighty.
 He can save from the pain of this world.
 
[v1]
 Well He wants to hold you tight
 And bring shelter through the night
 'Cause there's healing in His hand.
 
[v2]
 Well I'm ready for You to look O Lord
 In my heart's secret book
 'Cause I know You'll understand.
