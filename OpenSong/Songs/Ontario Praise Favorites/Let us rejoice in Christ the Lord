  <lyrics>[v1]
 Let us rejoice in Christ the Lord
 Who makes our cause His own.
 The hope that's built upon His word
 Can ne'er be overthrown.
 
[v2]
 Though many foes beset us round
 And feeble is our arm,
 Our life is hid with Christ in God
 Beyond the reach of harm.
 
[v3]
 Weak as we are we shall not faint
 Or, fainting, shall not fail;
 Jesus, the strength of every saint
 Forever must prevail.
 
[v4]
 Though now He's unperceived by sense
 Faith sees Him always near.
 A guide, a glory, a defence
 To save from every fear.
 
[v5]
 As surely as He overcame
 And conquered death and sin
 So surely those who trust His name
 Shall all His triumph win.
