  <lyrics>[c]
 If any man will follow, if any man will follow
 If any man will follow after my Jesus
 Let him deny himself, oh let him take up his cross 
 And let him come and follow after my Lord
 
[v1] 
 Whosoever will live for self will throw his life away
 Christ gives life to all who follow Him                                               
 What is a man advantaged if he gains the whole   wide world
 And then loses his soul
 
[v2]
 Whosoever will be ashamed of Jesus and His words
 In this sinful age in which we live
 Jesus the King will be ashamed of him in that great day
 When in glory He comes
