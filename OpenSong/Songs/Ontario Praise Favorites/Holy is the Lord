.G             C           D
 We stand and lift up our hands
.        Em         C           D
 for the joy of the Lord is our strength
.G       C                    D
 We bow down and worship Him now
.    Em         C        D
 How great how awesome is He
.                 A
 And together we sing

[c]
.             G    C      D
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty
.      Em      C               D
 the earth is filled with His glory
.             G    C      D
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty
.      Em      C               D
 the earth is filled with His glory
.      Em      C               D
 the earth is filled with his glory

 
[v2]
.G              D  
 It's rising up all around
.          F             C
 It's the anthem of the Lord's renown  (2x)
.                  A
 And together we sing 
.          C
 Everyone sing
