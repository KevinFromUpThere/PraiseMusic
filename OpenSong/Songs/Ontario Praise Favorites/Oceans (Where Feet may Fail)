  <title>Oceans (Where Feet may Fail)</title>
  <lyrics>; Bm Capo 2 or Em Capo 7

[v1]
. Em              D/F#    G
 You call me out upon the waters
.            D                    C
 The great unknown where feet may fail
. Em                   D/F#  G
 And there I find You in the mystery
.          D                  C
 In oceans deep my faith will stand

[c]
. C      G              D
 I will call upon Your Name
. C           G              D
 And keep my eyes above the waves
.            C
 When oceans rise
.             G              D
 My soul will rest in Your embrace
.         C         D       Em
 For I am Yours and You are mine



[v2]
. Em                    D/F#   G
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters
.               D               C
 Your sovereign hand will be my guide
. Em                      D/F#   G
 Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
.             D                          C
 You've never failed and You won't start now

---
[b]
. Em                      C
 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
.       G
 Let me walk upon the waters
.    D
 Wherever You would call me
. Em                     C
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
.       G
 And my faith will be made stronger
.       D
 In the presence of my Saviour</lyrics>
