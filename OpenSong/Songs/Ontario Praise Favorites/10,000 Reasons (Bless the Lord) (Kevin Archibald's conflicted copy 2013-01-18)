.E         A          E      B    C#m    A            E    B
 Bless the Lord, O my soul , O my soul , Worship His holy name
.          A       C#m    A B  C#m         A             B    E
 Sing like never before , O my soul , I'll worship Your holy name

[V1]
.    A         E          B       C#m
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
.A             E           B    C#m
  It's time to sing Your song again
.    A        E             B           C#m (Playout)
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies befor_e me
.A          E                B       E (Playout)
  Let me be singing when the evening comes

[v2]
.       A       E                B       C#m
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
.A             E               B          C#m
  Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
.    A            E            B       C#m (playout)
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on sin_ging
.A             E              B        E (playout)
  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


[v3]
.    A       E           B           C#m
 And on that day when my strength is failing
.A              E            B          C#m
  The end draws near, and my time has come
.A                  E         B        C#m (playout)
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unend_ing
.A             E                  B    E (playout)
  Ten thousand years and then for-ever-more</lyrics>
