.Em                 C/E
 Where You go, I’ll go
.                     G/D
 Where You stay, I’ll stay
.                    D
 When You move, I’ll move
.             Em C2 G D
 I will follow…

 All Your ways are good
.                  D
 All Your ways are sure
.         G      D/F# C
 I will trust in You alone

 Higher than my sight

 High above my life

 I will trust in You alone
