  <lyrics>[V1]
 
 Oh, the Fruit of the Spirit's not a coconut
 The Fruit of the Spirit's not a coconut
 If you want to be a coconut
 You might as well hear it
 You can't be the Fruit of the Spirit
 
[C]
 Cause the Fruit is
 Love, Joy, Peace, Patience,
 Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness,
 Gentleness and Self-control
 
 Love, Joy, Peace, Patience,
 Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness,
 Gentleness and Self-control
 
[V2]
 
 Oh, the Fruit of the Spirit's not a lemon
 The Fruit of the Spirit's not a lemon
 If you want to be a lemon
 You might as well hear it
 You can't be the Fruit of the Spirit
 
[V3]
 
 Oh, the Fruit of the Spirit's not a watermelon
 The Fruit of the Spirit's not a watermelon
 If you want to be a watermelon
 You might as well hear it
 You can't be the Fruit of the Spirit
 
[V4]
 
 Oh, the Fruit of the Spirit's not a cherry
 The Fruit of the Spirit's not a cherry
 If you want to be a cherry
 You might as well hear it
 You can't be the Fruit of the Spirit
 
[V5]
 
 Oh, the Fruit of the Spirit's not grapes
 The Fruit of the Spirit's not grapes
 If you want to be grapes
 You might as well hear it
 You can't be the Fruit of the Spirit
