  <title>Thankful</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I thank God for this day
 For some time to play outside
 For the birds in the trees
 For His love that's deep and wide
 For the air that I breath
 For my friends and family
 That's why I say thanks every day

[C]
 Because a thankful heart is a happy heart!
 I'm glad for what I have, that's an easy way to start!
 For the love that He shares as He listens to my prayers
 That's why I say thanks everyday

[V2]
 I thank God for this night for the stars in the sky
 For the hug from my mom for my special lullaby
 For the chance for some rest
 For the ways that I am blessed
 That's why I say thanks everyday
