  <lyrics>;CAPO 2 - Original in A


[V1]
.    G                     Em7
 The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
.                    C2
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
.   G                       G D Em7
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
.                    C2                     D
 And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice.
 
[C]
.    G                 D/F#
 How great is our God, sing with me,
.    Em7               D/F#
 How great is our God, all will see
.    Cmaj7      D            G  Gsus G
 How great, how great is our God.
 
[V2]
.G                         Em7
 Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
.                  C2                     D
 Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
.    G                      Em7 
 The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
.                 C2                     D
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

[T1]
.G                    D/F#
 Name above all names,
.Em7                 D/F#
 Worthy of all praise,
.   Cmaj7
 My heart will sing
.    D            G   Gsus G
 How great is our God.
 
[T2]
 
.              G     C             G
 Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.               D                   G
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art;
.                      C            G
 Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.               D  Am               G
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
