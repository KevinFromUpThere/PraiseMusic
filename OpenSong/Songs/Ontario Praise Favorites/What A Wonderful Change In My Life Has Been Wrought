  <lyrics>[V1]
.          G                                
 What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
.        C                  G
 Since Jesus came into my heart
.                                 Em
 I have light in my soul for which long I had sought
.       A7                 D7
 Since Jesus came into my heart
 
 
[C]
.        G
 Since Jesus came into my heart
.        C                  G
 Since Jesus came into my heart
.
 Floods of joy oâ€™er my soul
.              Em7
 Like the sea billows ro-o-o-o-o-ll
.  G     D                  G
 Since Jesus came into my heart
 
[V2]
 I have ceased from my wandering and going astray,
 Since Jesus came into my heart!
 And my sins which were many are all washed away,
 Since Jesus came into my heart!
 
[V5]
 I shall go there to dwell in that city I know,
 Since Jesus came into my heart!
 And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,
 Since Jesus came into my heart!</lyrics>
