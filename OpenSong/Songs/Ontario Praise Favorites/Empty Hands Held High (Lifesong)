. A F#m E D

.                 A                       F#m
 Empty Hands held high such a small sacrifice
.                       D
 If not joined with my life
.                Bm
 I sing in vain tonight
.                 A                   F#m
 May the words I say and the things I do
.                  E
 Make my lifesong sing
.                  D
 And bring a smile to you

[C]
.        A                E            F#m              D
 Let my lifesong sing to you,  Let my lifesong sing to you
.         D                   E
 I want to sign your name to the end of this day
.   F#m                   D           Bm        D      A
 knowing that my heart is true let my lifesong sing to you

[V2]

. A F#m E D
.                A                 F#m
 Lord I give my life living sacrifice
.                     D                         Bm
 to reach a world in need to be your hands and feet
.                  A                    F#m
 So may the words I say, and the things I do
.                  E                     D
 Make my lifesong sing and bring a smile to you
