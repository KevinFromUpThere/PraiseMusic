  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                            C   D
 Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
.D                         G
 Face to face—what will it be,
.G                    C
 When with rapture I behold Him,
.      D          D7       G
 Jesus Christ Who died for me?

[C]
.D                    G
 Face to face I shall behold Him,
.A                      D
 Far beyond the starry sky;
.G                       C
 Face to face in all His glory,
.         G      D      G
 I shall see Him by and by!

[V2]
.G                            C   D
 Only faintly now I see Him,
.D                         G
 With the darkened veil between,
.G                    C
 But a blessèd day is coming,
.      D          D7       G
 When His glory shall be seen.

[V3]
.G                            C   D
 What rejoicing in His presence,
.D                         G
 When are banished grief and pain;
.G                    C
 When the crooked ways are straightened,
.      D          D7       G
 And the dark things shall be plain.

[V4]
.G                            C   D
 Face to face—oh, blissful moment!
.D                         G
 Face to face—to see and know;
.G                    C
 Face to face with my Redeemer,
.      D          D7       G
 Jesus Christ Who loves me so.</lyrics></song>
