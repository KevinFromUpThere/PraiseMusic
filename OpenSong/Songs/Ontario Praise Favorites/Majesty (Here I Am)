;Capo 2 When Em Start
.Em   D C  Bm                    C
 Here I am humbled by your Majesty
.G/B                          D/F# B/D#
 covered by your grace so free
.Em   D C  Bm                     C
 Here I am knowing I'm a sinful man
.G/B                             D/F# B/D#
 covered by the blood of the lamb

[P]
.Em  D/F# G                           Em   D/F# G
 Now I've found, the greatest love of all is    mine
.                         A/C#                      C
 since you laid down your life, the greatest  sacrifice

[C]
.G     D  Em7   C
 Majesty, Majesty
.       G                            D
 Your grace has found me just as I am
.      Em                            C
 empty handed but alive in your hands

[V2]
 Here I am, humbled by the love that you give
 Forgiven so that I can forgive
 Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire
 Sanctified by glory and fire


[C2]
 Majesty, Majesty
 Forever I am changed by Your love
 in the presence of your Majesty</lyrics></song>
