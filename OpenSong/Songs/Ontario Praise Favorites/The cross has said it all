[V1]
.    G                 C/A      G/B               C
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
.  G               C/A                 G/B               C
 I can't deny what You have shown, the cross speaks of a God of love
.D                   C           Bm                C
 There displayed for all to see, Jesus Christ, our only hope
.  G       D       C               Bm                 C/A
 A message of the Father's heart, "Come my children, come on home"

[C]
.   G           C            G        D
 As high as the heavens are above the earth
.   G           C          G          D
 So high is the measure of Your great love
.   G          C       G        D
 As far as the east is from the west
.   G            C         G         D    G
 So far have You taken our sins from us

[V2]
.    G                 C/A      G/B               C
 The cross has said it all, the cross has said it all
.  G               C/A                 G/B               C
 I never recognised Your touch, until I met You at the cross
.D                   C           Bm                C
 We are fallen, dust to dust, how could You do this for us
.  G    D         C         Bm                 C/A
 Son of God, shed precious blood, who can comprehend this love
