  <lyrics>[Intro]
. A DII A DII A DII A EIII   
[V1]
.           A                  D             A
 You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb that was slain,
.                           D              E
 You ascended to heaven and ever more will reign;
.       A                       D           A
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim,
.                              E
 You will gather the nations before You.||
.                                                           D    E
 And the eyes of all men|will be fixed on the Lamb,|who was crucified
.                                                           D        E
 For with wisdom and mercy|and justice You'll reign|at Your Fatherâ€™s side
 
[C]
.        A                 D    A   E   
 And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb
.        A                    D    A  E  
 Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.'
.        A                  D   A     E   
 And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign
.       A                         D              A       
 As the King of all kings and the Lord of  all   lords.'
. A A D E EIII
 
[V2]
.           A                       D             A
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side,
.                                    D          E
 There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied;
.       A                       D              A
 As the Father has told us for these You have died,
.                            E
 For the nations that gather before You.||

 And the ears of all men|need to hear of the Lamb|who was crucified,
.                                                           D        E
 Who descended to hell|yet was raised up to reign|at the Father's side.</lyrics>
