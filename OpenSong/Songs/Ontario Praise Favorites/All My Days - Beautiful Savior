[v1]
.Bm7    C2 C           D          G/B C    G
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness

 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights
.Am7  Cmaj7   D                            
 For in      my       helplessness

 You heard my cry
.Am7   Cmaj7   Bm7 
 And waves of         mercy 
.                  E/G#  A 
 Poured down on my life

.A/G        D/F#    G             A    A/C#  D
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counselor
.Em                    Em/D
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history

 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life
.A/G            D/F#    G            A  A/C# D
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness

 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion
.A     Bm7   A            Bm7   C2  D
 And You reign, You reign over all
 
[v2]
.Bm7    C2  C          D       G/B    C    G
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
.Bm7   C2             D          G/B    C   
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
.Am7  Cmaj7   D   C  G/B      D
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed
.Am7   Cmaj7  Bm7                   E/G#  A
 Of death defeated and life without end

[v3]
.   Bm7    C2 C                D          G/B   C    G
 I long to be where the praise is never ending
.Bm7        C2 C                     D      G/B    C   
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
.Am7  Cmaj7   D                
 Where countless worshipers 
.C  G/B  D
 will share one song
.Am7   Cmaj7 Bm7  
 And cries     of '     worthy' 
.               E/G#  A
 Will honor the Lamb</lyrics></song>
