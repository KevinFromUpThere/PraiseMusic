  <title>I Wanna Do Everything for You (The ooo--ooo Song)</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 I wanna go into the streets tonight
 Shout about grace that's right
 You give me blessings, and then some more
 I've never seen mercy like this before

[c]
 Oh You're the one who died, and now you're alive
 Thank you for your love, You're more than enough
 You're the Rock for my soul, You made me whole it's true
 I wanna do everything for you-ooo...

[c2]
 ooo-ooooooo-oooo
 ooo-ooooooo-oooo
 ooo-ooooooo-oooo

[v2]
 Once upon a time I was lost
 I was sinning not knowing the cost
 You opened my eyes, and what did I see?
 A great sacrifice and victory!</lyrics>
