  <lyrics>[v1]
 I will never be the same again, 
 I can never return, I’ve closed the door; 
 I will walk the path, I’ll run the race, 
 And I will never be the same again.
 
[c]
 Fall like fire, soak like rain, flow like mighty waters, again and again; 
 Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff, and let a flame burn to glorify Your name.
 
[v2]
 There are higher heights, there are deeper seas, 
 Whatever You need to do Lord do in me; 
 The glory of God fills my life, 
 And I will never be the same again.
