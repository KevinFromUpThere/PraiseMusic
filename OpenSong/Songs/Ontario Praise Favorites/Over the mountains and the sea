[Intro]
.D Em7 G Asus4
 
[V1]
.D
 Over the mountains and the sea,
.Em7
 Your river runs with love for me,
.G                     Asus4
 And I will open up my heart,
.                          D
 And let the healer set me free.
.D
 I'm happy to be in the truth,
.Em7
 And I will daily lift my hands,
.G                         Asus4
 For I will always sing of when Your love came down, yeah!
 
[C]
.D                    Em7
 I could sing of Your love forever,
.G                    Asus4
 I could sing of Your love forever.
.D                    Em7
 I could sing of Your love forever,
.G                    Asus4
 I could sing of Your love forever.

.Em7           D
 Oo I feel like dancing-
.G                  A
 It's foolishness I know.
.Em                     D  
 But when the world has seen the light
.                     G              A
 They will dance with JOY like we're dancing now....
