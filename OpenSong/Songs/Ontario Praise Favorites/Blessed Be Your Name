[V]
.G       D                     Em            C
1Blessed be Your name in the   land that is  plentiful,
2Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me,
.           G               D              C
1Where Your streams of a____bundance flow, blessed be Your name;||
2When the   world's "all as it should be", blessed be Your name;||
.G           D                     Em               C
1And blessed be Your name when I'm found in the     desert place,
2And blessed be Your name on the   road marked with suffering,
.               G                D           C
1Though I       walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name.
2Though there's pain in the      offering,   blessed be Your name.

[P]
.G              D                 Em           C
 Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise,
.G                     D                Em           C
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say:
[C]
.               G           D                     Em   C
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name;
.               G           D                     Em       C
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your glorious name.
[T]
.    G              D        Em             C
 You give and take away; You give and take away;
.   G                    D          Em              C
 My heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be Your name.
