  <lyrics>[v1]
 I lift my heart to Thee,
 Savior Divine,
 For Thou art all to me,
 And I am Thine;
 Is there on earth a closer bond than this,
 That my Beloved’s mine, and I am His?
[v2]
 Thine am I by all ties,
 And chiefly Thine,
 For through Thy sacrifice
 Thou, Lord, art mine;
 By Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound
 Around me, closely I to Thee am bound.
[v3]
 To Thee, Thou Bleeding Lamb,
 I all things owe,
 All that I have and am,
 And all I know;
 All that I have is now no longer mine,
 And I am not my own: Lord, I am Thine.
[v4]
 How can I, Lord, withhold
 Life’s brightest hour
 From Thee; or gathered gold,
 Or any power?
 Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee,
 When Thou hast given Thine own dear Self for me?
[v5]
 I pray Thee, Savior, keep
 Me in Thy love,
 Until the world Thou sweep
 And me remove
 To that fair realm, where, sin and sorrow o’er,
 Thou and Thine own are one for evermore.</lyrics></song>
