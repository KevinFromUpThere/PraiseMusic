  <lyrics>[v1]
 Why should I fear man, when You made the heavens?
 Why should I be afraid, when You put the stars in place?
 Why should I lose heart, when I know how great You are?
 Why should I give up, when Your plans are full of Love?
 
[c]
 You shine brighter than the brightest star
 Your love purer than the purest heart
 You shine filling us with courage and strength
 To follow You
 
[v2]
 Why should I fear man, when You made the heavens?
 Why should I be afraid, when You put the stars in place?
 Why should I lose heart, when I know how great You are?
 Why should I give up, when Your plans are full of Love?
 
[b]
 “In this world you will have trouble”
 But You have overcome the world.
