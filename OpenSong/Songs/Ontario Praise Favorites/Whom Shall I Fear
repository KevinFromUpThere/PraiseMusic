[v1]
.G
 You hear me when I call
.G
 You are my morning song
.C
 Though darkness fills the night
.C 
 It cannot hide the light
.Em            C
 Whom shall I fear?
 
[v2]
.G
 You crush the enemy
.G
 Underneath my feet
.C 
 You are my sword and shield
.C
 Though troubles linger still
.Em             C 
 Whom shall I fear?
.Em             D
 Whom shall I fear?
--- 
[c]
.Em          D      G
 I know who goes before me
.Em          D      G
 I know who stands behind
.Em          C
 The God of angel armies
.C          D      G
 Is always by my side
.Em          D      G
 The one who reigns forever
.Em          D      G
 He is a friend of mine
.Em          C
 The God of angel armies
.C           D     G
 Is always by my side

 
[v3]
 My strength is in Your name
 For You alone can save
 You will deliver me
 Yours is the victory
 Whom shall I fear?
 Whom shall I fear?
 
[t]
.C                     G              D
 And nothing formed against me shall stand
.G                                  C
 You hold the whole world in Your hands
.C            G              D
 I'm holding on to Your promises
.        C    D        C    D
 You are faithful  You are faithful
.        C    D
 You are faithful</lyrics>
