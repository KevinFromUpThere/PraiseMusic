  <lyrics>[v1]
 When the music fades, all is stripped away,
 And I simply come; 
 Longing just to bring 
 Something that’s of worth that will bless Your heart
 
[v2]
 I’ll bring you more than a song 
 For a song in itself is not what You have required.
 You search much deeper within,
 Through the ways things appear
 You’re looking into my heart.
 
[c]
 I’m coming back to the heart of worship, 
 And it’s all about You, it’s all about You, Jesus.
 I’m sorry Lord for the thing I’ve made it
 When its all about You, it’s all about You, Jesus
 
[v3]
 King of endless worth, no one could express,
 How much You deserve.
 Though I’m weak and poor, 
 All I have is Yours, every single breath.
