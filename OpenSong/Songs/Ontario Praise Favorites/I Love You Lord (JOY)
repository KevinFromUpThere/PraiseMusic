 I love You, Lord, I worship You,
.                  A
 I love You, Lord, always.

 So thankful, Lord, You saved my life,
.                  A
 You saved my life today
 
[v2]
 And Lord, I love to bring to You,
 The honour due Your name;
 Just look at what You've done for me,
 I'll never be the same.
