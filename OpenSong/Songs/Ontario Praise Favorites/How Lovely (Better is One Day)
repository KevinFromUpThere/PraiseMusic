.G
 How lovely is your dwelling place
.  C2/Dsus
 Oh Lord Almighty
.G                                 Dsus
 My soul longs and even faints for you
.    G
 For here my heart is satisfied
.C          Dsus
 Within your presence
.   G                               Dsus
 I sing beneath the shadow of your wings
[C]
.        C2
 Better is one day in Your courts
.       Dsus
 Better is one day in Your house
.             C2
 Better is one day in Your courts
.        Dsus
 Than thousands elsewhere
[V2]
.  G                     C2
 One Thing I Ask and I would seek,
.         Dsus
 to see Your beauty
.G                                    Dsus
 To find you in the place Your glory dwells

[V3]
.Em7                        D
 My heart and flesh cry out,
.C                    D
 For you the living God
.Em7                 D       C   D
 Your Spirit's water for my soul.
.Em7                   D
 I've tasted and I've seen,
.C                  D
 Come once again to me
.Em7                   D
 I will draw near to you
.C                   Am  D
 I will draw near to you.</lyrics>
