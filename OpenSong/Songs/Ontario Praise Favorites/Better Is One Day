  <lyrics>[V1]
.    G5                             C2       Dsus
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,|O Lord Almighty;
.G5                                Dsus
 My soul longs and even faints for You.
.    G5                         C2          Dsus
 For here my heart is satisfied|within Your presence;
.  G5                              Dsus
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.

[C]
.          C2
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.          Dsus
 Better is one day in Your house,
.          C2
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.               Dsus      (E)
 Than thousands elsewhere.

[V2]
.    G5                           C2          Dsus
 One thing I ask, and I would seek: To see Your beauty,
.   G5                               Dsus
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells.

[T]
.Em7                    D   C2                  Dsus
 My heart and flesh cry out for You, the living God,
.Em7                 D      C2   Dsus
 Your Spirit's water for my soul;
.Em7                  D     C2                 Dsus
 I've tasted and I've seen, come once again to me,
.Em                  Dsus C2                  Am  Dsus
 I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You.</lyrics>
