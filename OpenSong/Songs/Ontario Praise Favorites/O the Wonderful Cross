.D       D2         Dsus/g    D
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.Dsus         D                 A
 On which the Prince of Glory died
.D    D2            Dsus      D
 My richest gain I count but loss
.D            A    Bm G   A  D
 And pour contempt on all my pride
 
[v2]
.D            D2        Dsus        D
 See from his head, his hands, his feet
.Dsus        D                A
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down
.D             D2         Dsus D
 Did ever such love and sorrow meet
.D            A    Bm G   A  D
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown
 
[C]
.        G      D/F#          G         D/F#
 O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
.         G                D/F#                  A
 Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
.       G        D/F#         G          D/F#
 || O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
.         G             D/F#                      A     A7
 All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name.

[v3]
.D         D2    Dsus            D
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
.Dsus           D               A
 That were an offering far too small
.D       D2    Dsus/g   D
 Love so amazing, so divine
.D            A   Bm G     A  D
 Demands my soul, my life, my all</lyrics>
