  <lyrics>[C]
.G              D            Em
 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
.              C      D         G
 A banner that flies across the sky;
.G                  D                 Em
 That all men might see the truth and know,
.          C      D      G
 He is the way to heaven.|

[B]
.G               D               Em             C     D      G
 We want to see, we want to see,|we want to see Jesus lifted high!
.G               D               Em             C     D      G
 We want to see, we want to see,|we want to see Jesus lifted high!|

[V]
.G       D                 Em
 Step by step we're moving forward,
.          C             Em
 Little by little we're taking ground;
.G     D                    Em
 Every prayer is a powerful weapon,
.                 C
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
.    D
 And down and down and down

[B2]
.G                D                Em              C     D      G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,|we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!
.G                D                Em              C     D      G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,|we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!</lyrics>
