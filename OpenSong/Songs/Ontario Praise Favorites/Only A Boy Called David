  <lyrics>[v1]
 Only a boy called David
 Only a little sling
 Only a boy called David
 And he could play and sing
[v2]
 Only a boy called David
 Only a rippling brook
 Only a boy called David 
 And five little stones he took
[c]
 And one little stone went in the sling
 And the sling went round and round 
 One little stone went in the sling
 And the sling went round and round 
 O round and round and round and round
 And round and round and round
 One little stone went up in the air 
 And the giant came tumbling down
