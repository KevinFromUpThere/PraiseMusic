[v1]
.C                  G
 What can I give to you

 What can I offer to the king

 For all the love you've shown
.D                      Em
 For all your mercy over me

[c]

 I called your name, you heard my cry

 Out of the grave, and into life

 My heart is yours, my soul is free

 The rock of salvation

 How great is your faithfulness

 You have your life upon the cross

 You suffered once for all

 You made a way

 Jesus in victory you rose

 You made us all your own

 Now we are saved</lyrics>
