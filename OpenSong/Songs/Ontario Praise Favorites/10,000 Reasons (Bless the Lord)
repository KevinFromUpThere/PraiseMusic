.C         F          C      G    Am     F            C    G

.          F       Am     F G  Am          F             G    C
 Sing like never before , 0 my soul , I'll worship Your holy name

[V1]
.    F         C          G       Am
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
.F             C           G    Am
  It's time to sing Your song again
.    F        C             G           Am (Playout)
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
.F          C                G       C (Playout)
  Let me be singing when the evening comes

[v2]
.       F       C                G       Am
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
.F             C               G          Am
  Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
.    F            C            G       Am (playout)
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing
.F             C              G        C (playout)
  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find


[v3]
.    F       C           G           Am
 And on that day when my strength is failing
.F              C            G          Am
  The end draws near, and my time has come
.F                  C         G        Am (playout)
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
.F             C                  G    C (playout)
  Ten thousand years and then for-ever-more</lyrics>
