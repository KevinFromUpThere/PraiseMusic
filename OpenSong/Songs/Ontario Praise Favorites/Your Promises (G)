  <lyrics>;This is pretty singable on CAPO1


[v1]
.         G                             C
 When the weight of the world begins to fall
.       G                    C
 On the Name of Jesus I will call
.      G                 C
 For I know my God is in control
.        G          C
 and His purpose is unshakable

[c]
. G                     D
 Doesn't matter what I feel
.                      Em7
 Doesn't matter what I see
.   D         C
 My hope will always be
.        D           G
 In Your promises to me
.                        D
 Now I'm casting out all fear
.                         Em7
 for Your love has set me free
.   D         C
 My hope will always be
.        D           G
 In Your promises to me

[v2]
.     G                     C
 As I walk into the days to come
.       G                        C
 I will not forget what You have done
.        G                      C
 For you have supplied my every need
.         G                      C
 and Your presence is enough for me

[b]
.         C                   G          D
 You will always be more than enough for me
.         C                   G          D
 You will always be more than enough for me
. C                    G
 Nothing's gonna stop the plans You've made
. D                    Em
 Nothing's gonna take Your love away
.         C         G                    D
 You will always be more than enough for me</lyrics>
