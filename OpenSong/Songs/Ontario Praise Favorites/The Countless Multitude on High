  <lyrics>[v1]
 The countless multitude on high
 Who tune their songs to Jesus' name
 All merit of their own deny,
 And Jesus' worth alone proclaim.
 Firm on the ground of sovereign grace
 The stand before Jehovah's throne;
 The only song in that blest place
 Is, "Thou art worthy, Thou alone!"
[v2]
 Salvation's glory all be paid
 To Him who sits upon throne;
 And to the Lamb whose blood was shed--
 "Thou, Thou art worthy, Thou alone;
 For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood
 These robes were washed so spotless pure;
 Thou mad'st us kings and priests to God,
 For ever let Thy praise endure."
[v3]
 Let us with joy adopt the strain
 We hope to sing for ever there--
 "Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain,
 Worthy alone the crown to wear!"
 Without one thought that's good to plead,
 Oh, what could shield us from despair,
 But this -- though we are vile indeed,
 The Lord our righteousness is there?</lyrics></song>
