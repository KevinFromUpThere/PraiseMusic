  <lyrics>[v1]
 Who is on the Lord’s side? Who will serve the King?
 Who will be His helpers, other lives to bring?
 Who will leave the world’s side? Who will face the foe?
 Who is on the Lord’s side? Who for Him will go?
  
[v2]
 Not for weight of glory, nor for crown and palm,
 Enter we the army, raise the warrior psalm;
 But for love that claimeth lives for whom He died:
 He whom Jesus nameth must be on His side.
 
[v3]
 Thou, O Lord hast bought us, not with gold or gem,
 But with Thine own life blood, for Thy diadem;
 With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee,
 Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free.
  
[v4]
 Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe,
 But the King’s own army none can overthrow;
 ’Round His standard ranging, victory is secure,
 For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.
 
[c]
 By Thy great redemption
 By Thy grace divine
 We are on the Lord's side
 Saviour, we are Thine</lyrics></song>
