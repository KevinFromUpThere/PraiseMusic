  <title>God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen</title>
  <lyrics>;CAPO 5


[V1]
.    Am
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
.    F           E7
 Let nothing you dismay;
.  Am
 Remember Christ our Savior
.    F                 E7
 Was born on Christmas Day
.   F               C
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
.     Am           G
 When we were gone astray.


[C]
.  C          E7          Am
 O tidings of comfort and joy,
.            G
 Comfort and joy;
.  C          E7          Am
 O tidings of comfort and joy.

[V2]
.    Am
 From God our heavenly Father
.  F             E7
 A blessed angel came,
.    Am
 And unto certain shepherds
.        F              E7
 Brought tidings of the same,
.    F            C
 How that in Bethlehem was born
.     Am           G
 The Son of God by name.

[V3]
.    Am
 And when they came to Bethlehem
.    F           E7
 Where our dear Saviour lay,
.  Am
 They found Him in a manger,
.    F           E7
 Where oxen feed on hay;
.   F               C
 His Mother Mary kneeling down,
.     Am           G
 Unto the Lord did pray.</lyrics>
