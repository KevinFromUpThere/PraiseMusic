[V1]
.    G        D      C          G
 The First Noel, the Angels did say
.       G            D            C              G
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
.   G            D        C             G
 In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
.     G             D          C      G
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
.  G     D     C     G    D
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
.G           D       C  G
 Born is the King of Israel!

[V2]
.    G        D      C          G
 Then let us all with one accord
.       G     D      C        G
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
.   G            D        C             G
 That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
.     G       D        C         G
 And with his blood mankind hath bought.
.  G     D     C     G     D
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
.G           D       C  G
 Born is the King of Israel!</lyrics>
