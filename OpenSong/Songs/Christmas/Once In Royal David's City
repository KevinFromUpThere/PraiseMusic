[V1]
.G    D7 G     D          G      Em  G     C D    G
 Once in royal David's city, stood a lowly cattle  shed,
.G     D7 G      A7       D7 G   Em G      C  D    G
 where a mother laid her baby in a manger for His  bed.
.C   G        Dsus4 D   G     C    G          C  D  G
 Mary was that mo - ther mild, Jesus Christ her little child.

[V2]
.G  D7   G       D             G      Em   G      C D    G
 He came down to earth from heaven, Who is God and Lord of all,
.     D7 G       A7    D7  G    Em     G      C  D  G
 And His shelter was a stable, and His cradle was a stall;
.C   G        Dsus4 D      G       C      G         C  D  G
 With the poor and meek and lowly, lived on earth our savior holy.

[V3]
.G    D7 G        D             G     Em  G      C  D         G
 And our eyes at last shall see Him, through his own redeeming love.
.     D7  G     A7       D7    G    Em     G       C   D  G 
 For that child so dear and gentle, is our Lord in heaven above;
.C   G        Dsus4 D     G   C     G           C  D  G
 And He leads His children on, to the place where he is gone.

[V4]
.G    D7 G        D             G     Em  G      C  D         G
 Not in that poor lowly stable, with the oxen standing by,
.     D7  G     A7       D7    G    Em     G       C   D  G 
 We shall see Him, but in heaven, set at God's right hand on high;
.C   G        Dsus4 D     G   C     G           C  D  G
 When like stars His children crowned, all in white shall wait around.</lyrics>
