Verse 1:
[G]I am so glad that our Father in heaven
[D7]Tells of His love in the  [C]Book He [D7]has   [G]given,
[G]Wonderful things in my Bible I see-
[D7]This is the dearest, that [C]Jesus [D7]loves [G]me.

Chorus:
[G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me,
[D7]Jesus loves me, [G]Jesus loves me.
[G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me;
[D7]Jesus loves even [G]me.
