[D]Amazing [D/F#]grace how [G]sweet the [D]sound
That [D]saved a wretch like [A]me
I [D]once was [D/F#]lost, but [G]now I'm [D]found
Was [D]blind but [A]now I s[D]ee

Chorus:
My chains are [G]gone, I've been set [D/F#]free.
My God, [G]My Savior has ransomed [D/F#]me.
And like a [G]flood his mercy [Bm]reigns.
[Em7]Unending love, [A]amazing [D]grace


Verse 2:
�Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

Verse 3:
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Verse 4:
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call�d me here below,
Will be forever mine.
(Will be forever mine)
(You are forever mine)
