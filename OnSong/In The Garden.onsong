Verse 1:
I [G]come to the garden alone, While the [C]dew is still on the [G]roses;
And the [D]voice I hear falling [G]on my ear, The [A7]Son of God dis[D]closes.
Chorus:
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.

Verse 2:
He [G]speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so [C]sweet the birds hush their [G]singing;
And the [D]melody that He [G]gave to me, With[A7]in my heart is [D]ringing.

Chorus:
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.

Verse 3:
I'd [G]stay in the garden with Him, Though the [C]night around me be [G]falling;
But He [D]bids me go; thru the [G]voice of woe, His [A7]voice to me is [D]calling.

Chorus:
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.
